1. What did you do?
Nea sought support for a writing assignment in SOC 102. She is Finnish and the writing assignment is in English. Her spoken English is clear and accurate. She understands English grammar and her writing shows some depth of English vocabulary. 
Nea is not scheduled for additional tutoring session. Discussing her academic schedule, it might be of use for her to schedule every other week. This would capture writing assignments in the ENL and SOC courses. She tends to work ahead of due dates so the biweekly schedule might work for her.
Grammarly, Citefast, and Purdue OWL were recommended as support sites. Additionally, Deeple was recommended.
Lastly, there was a brief suggestion to compare SOC theorists using a simple side by side graph that can be sketched for best usage. The purpose of the graph is to see the similarities and differences among the theories. This is an effective study strategy for this type of content and will prefer her for the first exam.
2. Changes in assignment due dates: 
None reported at this time.

3. Updates on assignment completion: 
SOC 102: Writing Assignment, Critical and opinion piece about the upcoming US election
ENL
ECON
4. Behavior/Struggles/Tardiness: 
No concerns whatsoever
5. Additional Comments: 
Nea is on the SU Hockey team; she is a Forward or Center
Nea is from Finland. She reports going to bed early and that she prefers this for her best effort on the ice.

To all of these he does not seem receptive and just says he understands, when it still appears that he is skipping questions and getting answers wrong.

Not only we review basic ASL signs, but also went over the sport signs he had learned in ASL 102 class so far. In addition, Daniel had an assignment that is due this Friday that focused on ASL signs for sports and information on ASL signs. ","From the beginning, I could tell he is struggling to keep up with the ASL course because of how the class is being taught and he was overwhelmed. As the result, we spent more time discussing the differences in ASL grammatical syntax versus spoken English. Gradually, he was able to successfully complete his assignment on ASL signs for sports and ASL grammatical syntax. Though it took longer than I expected, I am glad that he was able to push through despite having difficulties in learning ASL. Also, in the end of session, he stated that he feel like he can do ABCs and numbers in ASL now unlike before!",I highly suggested to Daniel that he can work on his finger spelling to help him with memorizing the ABCs in ASL better. Alphabets in ASL is critical for communication. I focused on the method of repetition which Daniel seem to respond well and have him sign back to me. ,No professor feedback was received since it was the only second week of class.,"At the beginning of the session, Daniel made it clear with me about his concerns regarding to the ASL course and that he is really worried that he may not be able to learn ASL as quickly as he would have liked. Based on my initial assessment with practicing basics of ASL, I understand his concerns and that he want to do well in class. In my opinion, I think having more time in ASL tutoring would be really good for him. ", No,YES

The last homework assignment for this week focused on recording himself on GoReact talking about recipe for food.

","He was able to complete and submit all three assignments. The first homework due this Friday was super challenging because it involves a lot of facial expressions and mouth movements in ASL. Though it took a huge chuck of time, he was still able to complete it. He had a much better comprehension for the second homework assignment with glossing using ICL. The last homework assignment focusing on describing his food in ASL was a bit harder for him as he needed to write down his signing on a paper before he could record. ","Since Daniel had completed all of his work for this week, he will need to continue practicing his signs prior to next session and bring in any lecture notes from class.

Based on my short assessment by asking her various questions regarding the concepts, it was very clear that there was a huge learning gap between her professor's teaching and her actual learning of the course materials. Then, we reviewed the rules for nomenclature and some of the organic chemistry mechanisms with alkenes: halogenation and hydration.    ",Mackenzie was able to complete and submitted her Chapter 10 assignments on her own.,"Since Mackenzie will need to review a ton of Organic Chemistry I mechanisms for alkenes and alkynes, I decided to give her some of my lecture notes from my Organic Chemistry Class in different college on mechanisms as a guide for multiple reactions. In the meantime, she will need to take a look at these notes and come in prepared to ask questions for the next session. ","Mackenzie was very honest that she did not do well in her second exam which was unexpected for her. To be fair, Organic Chemistry I is a really difficult class no matter how strong students can be. Everyone struggle at some point during the course.","I have several concerns during the session. I am actually worried that Mackenzie could fall behind really quickly because there aren't enough time for her to comprehend old concepts and learn new concepts simultaneously. Because of the time constraints and it is a last minute tutoring session, I do not know how much can I help her at this point. I will do my best to make sure she is on track with her learning in the course. However, I am more shocked by how her professor teach the course which tells me that it is definitely a major problem in teaching. Her professor provided inadequate amount of effort in helping students comprehend the course. I would recommend that she have at least 2 hours of tutoring to help improve her academic performance in the course. The reason I say this is because the longer you stay in Organic Chemistry I, it will get so much harder with more information to retain if you cannot understand the previous concepts. ", No,YES

I suggested we could try different studying techniques (handwriting notes over and over again, reading aloud, going over the content a little each day instead of cramming the day before, and me quizzing him). This Friday we are going to use that time to focus on the paper he has due in that class this upcoming week. I think that he can get a lot more points writing about the artworks and applying the knowledge in that way than in the quizzes. So I think that will be a better focus of our time since he has a hard time remembering content in a quiz/test environment.

1. What did you do?
Tonight is the first session with Christian. He is a Graduate Student and has a 20-25 page paper to write. He has written 10 page papers before but is daunted just thinking about writing a 20-25 page paper.
Time was spent discussing his topic and the process for this paper - organization, sections, including the introduction and culminating sections of the paper. Christian located a few peer-reviewed articles and is aware he will need at least ten peer reviewed articles in addition to high quality news sources such as the New York Times, the Washington Post, Reuters, and Politico. In addition, he will need online sites such the CIA World Fact Book, the WHO, and the World Atlas. 
Christian’s goal for the week is to locate as many articles and sources as possible. He was encouraged to locate and record sources even if he is unsure of the source will be used. Additionally, Christian will need to record all online sources to use in this research paper. The next steps will be to organize the information in sections and evaluate if there are any gaps of information that may need to be located. 
Christian was reminded that he will need to spend hours, about three or four) searching for sources but that all of an article or source may not be needed. For example, there were several reports about the mineral wealth of Afghanistan that will be relevant to the reason for countries who want an interest in this industry. Not all parts of such a report will be needed but the source will be used for relevance. 
Christian seemed to feel the session was useful to him and he is looking for additional times to meet.

1. What did you do?
Tonight was the second session with Christian. He is a Graduate Student and has a 20-25 page paper to write. 
Time was spent reviewing his topic and the process for this paper - organization, sections, including the introduction and culminating sections of the paper. Christian created a presentation for the research paper. He has sources from the presentation which will be used in the paper. He also created graphs and timelines that could be part of a Glossary for this paper. It appears he can use MLA format. The format may be a choice. Citefast.com was suggested as a citation tool. Christian located the site and he could see the long list of possible citation sources such as presentation, lectures, interviews, and other less traditional sites. The citation tool also creates in-text citations which will be helpful to him in this longer paper.
The search for sources revealed a NATO source which he used in his presentation and will use in the paper. They are all online sources. He did use the CIA World Fact Book, the WHO, and the World Atlas. 
Time was spent writing the introduction and creating list of sections for this paper. A list of sections or paragraphs was written. The order will be reviewed and changed as appropriate for the organization of this paper. Christian was encouraged to write or use bullet points to put information into all sections listed for this paper. The order can be changed later. He is aware the conclusion will be more than one paragraph and will need to reflect the complexities found in the paper.
Christian is interested in another session and he asked about a Zoom session. 
2. Changes in assignment due dates: 
None reported at this time.

3. Updates on assignment completion: 
NA
4. Behavior/Struggles/Tardiness: 
No concerns whatsoever
5. Additional Comments: 
Christian is a Lacrosse forward and is a transfer from Lehigh.

Financial Accounting = Outside  

Managerial Accounting = Manager's perspective on how they can improve the company from the inside out: 

Statements of Cash Flows 
Income statements 
  

Accounting Equation 

  

Assets = Liabilities + Equity 

  

Assets = Clothes, Laptop, Car, House, Accounts Receivable, Cash 

An asset is anything that you can liquidate for cash 

  

Liabilities = Accounts Payable, Income Taxes payable, Unearned Revenues, Long-Term Debt 

  

Equity (Stockholder's Equity, Investments/Wall Street/Percentages) = Investments in other companies, dividends, stocks, paid-in capital, retained earnings 

  

Income Statement -> Statement of Retained Earnings -> Balance Sheet -> Statement of Cash Flows 

  

Income Statement -> quarterly representation of how the company is doing. Revenues - Expenses 

Balance Sheet -> A = L + E  will be your go-to! We've done our Balance Sheet correctly when our Assets is equal to the bottom two sections of the balance sheet (L + E) 

Statement of Cash Flows -> What is going into your business and then what are you getting out of it?  

Investing Activities 
Financing Activities 
Operating Activites 
  

Statement of Retained Earnings 

Retained Earnings = What we have left over for the company next year/quarter/etc. 
Dividends to be paid to shareholders 
Subtract Raw Retained Earnings - Dividends 
  

  

Debits and Credits 

Debits = What goes in (Assets) 

Credits = What goes out or what is not guaranteed ","Bo didn't have any assignments to work on this week since she cannot access her MyAccountingLab yet. Once she figures out how to access this, we can walk through homework if she needs help and better understand concepts/problems covered in class.","Goals for Next Session (January 30th)

She is very motivated and interested in the material this semester. She wants these sessions to be review sessions to prepare for upcoming exams. She is a visual learner so that I will factor that into my next session.,"We did our introductions, and I asked questions to get to know Olivia better as a student. We covered some of her syllabus and due dates for her Mastering Biology assignments and test dates that she inputted into her calendar. We then went over some of the questions for Mastering Biology and we went over her notes from class that she took. The class seems to be just starting, so Olivia's notes will be incomplete until next session.","The student is making good progress on her first Mastering Biology homework assignment and could even move to the next chapter that is texted within the homework software. The student seems to be on top of their notes and the homework assignments for this course. The due date for the assignment is later in the semester, which is why it is not submitted.","The student will try to use active recall techniques and everyday exposure to the material to become familiar with it before her first test, which covers many chapters. The student expressed interest in making a quizlet and will begin adding the terms for this class, which tends to be vocabulary-heavy. The student hopes to return with more completed notes and wants to be asked questions about the material after going to more of the upcoming lectures.",The student had not received any professor feedback as it is too early in the semester.,No concerns were raised but the student did say they don't want to hit a point where they're not engaged and wants to stay on top of her assignments., No,YES
