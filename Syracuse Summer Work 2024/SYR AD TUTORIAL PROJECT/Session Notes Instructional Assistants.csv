1.	What did you do?
2.	Oct 13 Orange Tip Off; Orange Magic Oct 21 (6-8 pm); Exhibition Games Oct 31 (% pm on Tuesday)

This week- Sophie has the following due: NSD 225-DAP #2- Sept 17-100%; OCE - Sept 18-87%; WRT 105 – Sept 19 – submitted but NGY; PSY 205 – Sept 25-27-Sophie will decide which day to take this exam-90%; SOC 102 – Sept 27-NGY. 
The next group of exams are spread out more than this first group. The dates were discussed in session. 
Sophie reports liking to go to bed early. Sophie reports that at the day’s end when classes are over for the day- she typically does not do academics. This is desirable because she has daytime slots for academic work. The planned timeslots were reviewed and noted below. Sophie is aware that as she gets into her season- she may need to adjust her academic time slots and this will be watched and adjusted as needed. Sophie likes to use Fridays and Saturdays to catch up on academic work for the week but the goal is still to complete what is needed for Monday by Friday afternoon.
Sophie knows how to be a student. She takes notes in class and uses them for exam prep and for HW.
There was a discussion about pacing herself so she does not overdo or over work. She is a student and seems to like her courses. The courses are demanding and require focused and continuing exposure to recall information for her best performance. Sophie is aware that after the first exams- she can determine if she needs to continue the same amount of preparation or be able to reduce her preparation time and perform as well as she did for the first exams. At this point- the primary conversation is maintaining efficiency so Sophie gets what she wants but is not overworking.

Academic Identified Times
•	Sophie uses Sundays to complete most of her assignments especially for assigned HW. WBB games tend to be on Fridays and Sundays. Sundays may not work for academic work once her season begins.  The overall goal is to have all assignments completed by Friday evening. Sundays- if possible- will be when Sophie can check BB and her SU email for any changes in assignments of due dates.
•	Tuesdays and Thursdays have a daytime slot that she uses to complete NSD work. The timeslot will also be used for PSY and/or Oceanography. On Mondays- Sophie has a timeslot from 3:10-5:15. This is still a working plan for completing her academic work and should work when she enters her season. Sophie reports the courses are not too much for her. 
•	The Oceanography homework assignments are to be completed in Recitation so this gives Sophie more time to complete other assignments outside of classes and practice. Both lecture and recitation in Oceanography may be used as exam preparation. This was discussed and reviewed again in session tonight- 9-28-23.
•	Three minutes after class to review her notes while her mind is on the material is a strategy discussed and reviewed again in session. After the three minutes- she is to review this material in the evening for about 15 minutes then do not review it again until the next day. This process fosters recall.

1. What did you do?
Michael had a paper planner with him. He writes his assignments in the planner. He tends to write assignments weekly. Michael reports he likes to do an assignment as soon as it is assigned and he prefers his planner to using an Objective Sheet or his phone.
Michael’s goal for tonight was to write a one-page paper synthesizing two chapters in the ebook for CRS 325. The synthesis for chapters 4 and 5 are due tomorrow by 5 pm. He reports he does not forget due dates- in part- because he completes the assignment when it is assigned. However- he was interested in completing assignments in advance so as to completely finish a part of the required assignments for CRS 325. Michael requested help in reading the assigned chapters and writing a one-page synthesis paper. The first synthesis paper was 70%.
Michael reports he did not perform well academically last semester. He also reported that he does not like to read and that he is a skimmer. Michael prefers classes that do require MC tests.

1. What did you do? 
Zeynep is a PSY major. She is taking two psychology courses this semester. 
Zeynep asked for support for a Sociology writing assignment. This is a 500-1000-word assignment about one of the four types of racism – overt- cultural- color-blind- and biological racism. Additionally- Zeynep is requited to use public sources- such as news sources to support the examples she finds to define the two types of racism she chose to for this writing assignment. 
Zeynep chose to write about overt racism and cultural racism. She located several online sources for the assignment. Much of the assignment was completed in tonight’s session. However- she will need to elaborate and to add citations to the assignment. 
The second assignment is shorter and she will write this outside of tutoring. Zeynep’s written English is excellent but she tends to be less confident in writing in English.

1. What did you do?
This is still a goal - Mondays was an added timeslot for academic work. Sophie uses Sundays to complete most of her assignments especially for assigned HW. WBB games tend to be on Thursdays and Sundays. Sundays may not work for academic work once her season begins. This was discussed. The overall goal is to have all assignments completed by Friday evening. Sundays- if possible- will be when Sophie can check BB and her SU email for any changes in assignments of due dates.

This timeframe is still viable - Tuesdays and Thursdays have a daytime slot that she uses to complete NSD work. The timeslot will also be used for PSY and/or Oceanography. Fridays are a time she can do most of her academic work. She has one class on Friday then has the day to complete academic and plan other academic assignments. On Mondays- Sophie has a timeslot from 3:10-5:15. She uses it for readings and homework. Reading for SOC Problems is probably how Mondays will be used. This is still working plan for completing her academic work and should work when she enters her season. Sophie reports the courses are not too much for her. However- she may drop the PST one-credit class.

The Oceanography homework assignments are to be completed in Recitation so this gives Sophie more time to complete other assignments outside of classes and practice. Both lecture and recitation in Oceanography may be used as exam preparation. This was discussed so she can use three minutes after class to review her notes while her mind is on the material. Then she is to review it in the evening for about 15 minutes then do not review it again until the next day. This process fosters recall. 

Sophie may be able to do some of the WRT assignments in advance or- at least- early in the assignment. This will benefit her because her exams and tests tend to cluster together. The first short assignment was submitted on time. The video will be submitted on time. 
This week- Sophie has the following due: NSD 225-DAP #2- Sept 17-100%; OCE - Sept 18; WRT 105 – Sept 19 - NGY; PSY 205 – Sept 25-27-Sophie will decide which day to take this exam; SOC 102 – Sept 27. Sophie is aware that the next two weeks will be more demanding than previous weeks. She is also aware that due dates will likely cluster for upcoming tests.
Sophie reports liking to go to bed early. Sophie knows how to be a student. So far- the PSY 205 course is reviewing prior knowledge for Sophie. Preparing for the first PSY exam was discussed. Sophie decided to handwrite notes on the Study Guide (she printed the study guide in tutoring and created spaces so she can write notes next to the content). Possible questions were discussed for some material. Additionally- for confusing information such as the neurotransmitters- making a side-by-side chart to see differences was suggested because it’s easier to see the differences and less confusing when some information is similar. 
There was a discussion about pacing herself so she does not overdo or over work. She is a student and seems to like her courses. The courses are demanding and require focused and continuing exposure to recall information for her best performance. Sophie is aware that after the first exams- she can determine if she needs to continue the same amount of preparation or be able to reduce her preparation time and perform as well as she did for the first exams.

1. What did you do? 
Time was spent reviewing Trey’s classes. The challenging course for him is the SOC 101 course. This course meets once a week for 2.5 hours. Trey reports that by the time the course hits two hours- his mind id wandering. 
Time was spent reviewing the current course content. Although the course requires- Mapping the Social Landscape- there are additional readings posted weekly that are highly academic by Durkheim- Lareau- Weber- Bourdieu and other philosophers in Sociology. The readings are lengthy and are written in formal academic and philosophical language. These readings are not particularly engaging especially for a freshman. 
Another consideration is that the slides reviewed in tonight’s session indicated a first ever teacher/instructor who may not understand her audience. 
Trey reported that his group project was graded as 50%. According to Trey- the Instructor is going to give his group feedback so they know why their grade is so low. His grade on the first exam was 75% which is a reasonable grade for this class. 
Trey reported that he missed the last class because he went home for a long weekend. This class was on Durkheim- Bourdieu- Weber- and Lareau. The slides covered Habitus and other difficult concepts. It will be important to put the theories and key concepts in a form easy to see and to foster recall.

1.	What did you do? 
DJ’s goal is to improve his GPA. Last semester his GPA was 3.2ish. 
DJ has a planning tool that organizes assignments in bars and shows when each are completed and submitted. He continues to use this tool.
DJ studied for the HFS 479 exam next week on Monday. Time was spent reviewing his notes from the lecture. The material is or can be discouraging because it is about abuse in all its ugly fashions. It is about misuse of power and control. DJ was affected by the ugly nature of much of the content. However- time was spent discussing and reviewing the content- specifically different theories of domestic violence and basic information about intimate partner violence. DJ had numerous pages of notes. There was time to cover about a third of the material.
Time was spent discussing chunking his study time with short breaks in between each chunk of study time. The process would be something such as the following: 20 minutes study- 3 minutes off- 15 minutes study- 2-3 minutes off- 10 minutes study- 1-2 minutes off. Take a break of a couple of hours and repeat the process. In other available timeslots- study or review for about 3 to 5 minutes with his mind on the material and in the evening about 15 to 20 minutes that is a read- write- say- and record high detailed content. Note cards is an option to use for this type of exam preparation. 
Additionally- DJ was reminded to study for the NSD 225 exam next Tuesday. This is a high-detail course and he can use a similar chunking technique to study this material. It often works to study two different contents back to back. It works sort of like cross-training.

1. What did you do? 
The challenging course for Trey continues to be the SOC 101 course. Other than a reading by Johnson- there is no new assignment posted for this course. Trey reported that he emailed the professor letting her know that one of the group members did not participate in the last assignment which is similar to an essay exam. He also included that he answered a question so it would not be blank but was not prepared to answer it and is aware this answer was not answered as well as it could have been answered. 
Micro Econ was discussed. Trey reported that he forgot about the first Econ exam. Although he has a tutor for Micro Econ- he forgot to prepare for this exam and walked into an exam with surprise. However- he earned 75% for the exam. He reports the online HWs tend to be difficult application problems. He typically does them with the Econ tutor and his grades have improved. There is room for continued improvement. The next exam is October 19. This course does not have posted exam dates. It is speculated that tomorrow’s class will be a review and that Thursday will be the exam. 
A brief amount of time was spent discussing academic strategies that are efficient so Trey has more control over his time.
Trey reports most of his academic work in the evening after 7:00. He takes a short break then does his academic work. He has more time on Fridays to do academic work. Trey noted he sometimes uses the kitchen table but has started going into his room and closing the door for better concentration. 
No new grades were reported.
2. Changes in assignment due dates: 
None reported at this time.

1.	What did you do?
2.	Oct 13 Orange Tip Off; Orange Magic Oct 21 (6-8 pm); Exhibition Games Oct 28 (% pm on Tuesday)

Sophie had the following due: WRT105 – Sept 19 – submitted 25/25. The next WRT 105 Unit is in progress. There is no other feedback for WRT 105. 
Time was spent discussing the first exams and how she studied for them. She reported the second OCE exam was harder than the first exam. She reports preparing the same way as she did for the first exam. The current PSY 205 quiz is about memory. The Weekly PSY quiz is after tutoring. She goes back to campus to Marshall Street Mall to an upstairs’ classroom for PSY recitation.  
As she is preparing for the NSD 225 exam #1- she is doing extra credit assignments and answering the Study Guide lists. So far- her favorite course is PSY. According to Sophie and in general- the content for NSD is very difficult and requires a lot of memorization. 
Sophie shared that she was offered a WBB Pro Contract after High School. However- she decided to go to college first because if she went pro in Australia- she could not return to college in Australia.
This was discussed in today’s tutoring: Sophie is aware that after the first exams- she can determine if she needs to continue the same amount of preparation or be able to reduce her preparation time and perform as well as she did for the first exams. At this point- the primary conversation is maintaining efficiency so Sophie gets what she wants but is not overworking.

Academic Identified Times
•	Sophie uses Sundays to complete most of her assignments especially for assigned HW. WBB games tend to be on Fridays and Sundays. Sundays may not work for academic work once her season begins.  The overall goal is to have all assignments completed by Friday evening. Sundays- if possible- will be when Sophie can check BB and her SU email for any changes in assignments of due dates.
•	Tuesdays and Thursdays have a daytime slot that she uses to complete NSD work. The timeslot will also be used for PSY and/or Oceanography. On Mondays- Sophie has a timeslot from 3:10-5:15. This is still a working plan for completing her academic work and should work when she enters her season. Sophie reports the courses are not too much for her. 
•	The Oceanography homework assignments are to be completed in Recitation so this gives Sophie more time to complete other assignments outside of classes and practice. Both lecture and recitation in Oceanography may be used as exam preparation. This was discussed and reviewed again in session tonight- 9-28-23.
•	Three minutes after class to review her notes while her mind is on the material is a strategy discussed and reviewed again in session. After the three minutes- she is to review this material in the evening for about 15 minutes then do not review it again until the next day. This process fosters recall.

1. What did you do?
Saniaa reported completing the current 10-page paper in about four hours. She was mentally prepared and worked her ideas out visually on the whiteboard then reviewed them. This is how she works- once her ideas are in her mind- she writes until she is finished. This process works for her. So far- her grades have benefited from her process.
She reported needing to get the next book- Free to Learn by Peter Grey- for the CRS 388 course and will check the SU Book Store for its availability. It has not been available.
The first Spanish exam grade was not what she wanted; she is aware that every accent mark is graded. She is thinking to use note cards to prepare for the next exam. This was discussed. She has a square envelop to keep the note cards together. It was suggested that she revisit Spanish vocabulary four times weekly outside of class for 15 minutes in which she says the word- spells the word- writes the word- draws a picture of the word- and repeats it twice. It was also suggested that she do no more than 10 at one time. She could also say the word and its meaning into her phone and listen to it throughout the day. The goal is to keep information fresh. 
Saniaa made 3.8 GPA last semester. She has much to be proud of.

1. What did you do?
Time was spent reviewing her courses and her schedule. Sophie created a document showing her courses and her athletic schedule. This was useful. Times for planning and doing academic work were reviewed. Mondays was an added timeslot for academic work. Sophie uses Sundays to complete most of her assignments especially for assigned HW. The discussion was that as she enters pre-season and her season- some of the times slotted for academic work may change to rest or relaxation. It‘s important to be mindful of not doing too much and to take breaks.

Tuesdays and Thursdays have a daytime slot that she uses to complete NSD work. The timeslot will also be used for PSY and/or Oceanography. Fridays are a time she can do most of her academic work. She has one class on Friday then has the day to complete academic and plan other academic assignments. On Mondays- Sophie has a timeslot from 3:10-5:15. She uses it for readings and homework. Reading for Soc Problems is probably how Mondays will be used.

She is taking PSY- Oceanography- Writing 105- and Nutrition. These are the courses that will demand the most time and three are high-detail courses. 
The Oceanography homework is a paper copy of information- graphic illustrations- and key vocabulary and terms. There was a discussion about using these HWs (similar to Labs) as a study guide for the exam on Sept 18- about nine days from now. This seemed to appeal to Sophie. These assignments are to be completed in Recitation so this gives Sophie more time to complete other assignments outside of classes and practice. 

Sophie reports she does not like to write. The WRT 105 course was discussed in some detail. The first assignment- a self-portrait was discussed. This assignment is a multi-modal visual journal of times and places when she writes. Several ideas were discussed. Sophie plans to make this assignment a video.
Sophie reports liking to go to bed early. Sophie knows how to be a student. So far- the PSY 205 course is reviewing rior knowledge for Sophie.

1.	What did you do?
Chapter 8 focuses on delivery and different modes of delivery. Additionally- this chapter will inform the Deliberative Speech which is his next speech. The recent chapter synthesis grade is 80%. There should be feedback at some point.
Michael continues to use his planner. He has several papers coming in the next few weeks. One is the paper for the PHI course. He was reminded that this paper should be discussed and planned. The paper due date was pushed back to October 28. Michael reports the prompt has not been posted. 
Michael reports completing the presentation for SOC 102. It is due Monday.
Time was spent discussing the PHP 121 BCP- Part 2. Michael understood that he is to use the inventories he created in Part 1- name his risk factor and disease- then write a paper using sources to support his points to reduce and avoid his risk. He is choosing heart disease as his risk factor. At this time- Michael is on a ‘diet’ to prepare for his upcoming season and to lose weight for the same reason. It was suggested that he use his own story- so to speak- as a conclusion to Part 2. In addition to losing weight- he reported one reason he is eating differently is because he feels better. This is perfect for Part 2.

1. What did you do?
Michael’s goal for this semester and next semester is to earn a 3.00 GPA. This will allow him to declare a major. Michael was encouraged to think about steps to achieve his goal. He did not have steps in mind but will think about how to get to the 3.00 GPA.
Time was spent working on the Proposal for the Deliberative Speech. The proposal is due October 4- the Outline is due October 16- and the speech October 16. This took some time because Michael was not clear about a topic for this particular type of speech. Michael chose the topic- Health Habits- and will included life style- physical exercise- and mental health. He will have examples from Ted Talks and factual information from .gov sites and peer reviewed sources. He included one source in the proposal. His first proposal grade was 7.7/10- 77%- which he considered a very good grade. His first proposal was shorter than the second proposal. 
A Do and Due type of plan will be discussed in the next session. Michael wrote additional due dates in his planner.
Michael reports he did not perform well academically last semester/last year. He also reported that he does not like to read and that he is a skimmer. Michael prefers classes that do not require MC tests.

1. What did you do? 
The challenging course for Trey continues to be the SOC 101 course. 
Trey reported that one group member in SOC 101 did not participate in the group assignment. He suggested to the group that they share the last question. He was not prepared to write the last question but did write something so that last questions was not empty. One group member emailed the professor so there is an awareness that a group member did not participate. Trey was willing to write something at the last minute to fulfill the assignment’s requirements. 
Trey spent some time watching a video for the FYS class and filled out a personal engagement plan grid. It appears that the first assignment is to fill out one column. He did this in tutoring. There was a discussion about writing about both his Native culture as well as the college and team culture. Trey dis this and submitted the first part of the assignment.
Time will be spent reviewing the other classes in the next sessions.
This was reinforced: 10-12-23 Trey was encouraged to use key terms- note the part of the conversation he is using to develop his answers- to use examples and to elaborate from his examples. The book- They Say- I Say- was used for templates appropriate for college students who are developing their academic writing skills. Trey found the templates useful and understood how phrasing such as- ‘in other words’ could support elaboration. 
Trey reports most of his academic work in the evening after 7:00. He takes a short break then does his academic work. He has more time on Fridays to do academic work. Trey noted he sometimes uses the kitchen table but has started going into his room and closing the door for better concentration.

Saniaa wrote her ides for the second of the five books (CRS 338) on the whiteboard so she can organize her ideas for writing ten pages. There were 13 themes that she will use as sections of this paper. The paper is due next Thursday. She has not started the book but seems to have found the topic interesting. The overall ideas in the book were discussed.  
Saniaa reported that in today’s lecture in CRS 338- the lecture included the concept- ‘theory of mind’. This was used to inform each of the 13 key actions of parents who raise mentally strong- resilient children. The book is Thirteen Things Mentally Strong Parents Don’t Do by Amy Marin. Once theory of mind was used to evaluate the book- chapter by chapter- the assignment took on meaningful characteristics and made the book worth reading. Theory of Mind (ToM) was discussed in detail and Saniaa will keep this concept in mind as she reads the book for this assignment. 
There was a discussion about times in her week for academic work. There was also a discussion about planning her Friday timeframe which is the most open time she has for academic work. Her schedule also has time slots on Tuesday and Thursdays. The discussion was for Thursdays to include planning for Friday and for Tuesdays to work on Spanish and plan that coursework for the semester. This timeframe is still working for Saniaa. 
Saniaa made 3.8 GPA last semester. She has much to be proud of.

1. What did you do?
In the last tutoring session- Saniaa wrote her ides for the second of the five books (CRS 338) on the whiteboard so she can organize her ideas for writing ten pages. There were 13 themes that she will use as sections of this paper. Time was spent discussing the book- noted below- and how it applies and applied to her life as a youth and now. Additionally- she discussed her ‘bucket list’ and the things she wants to accomplish before she settles into a relationship and starts her own family.
The paper is due tomorrow- Thursday. She reported she has two chapters to read to complete the book and seems to have found the topic interesting. The overall ideas in the book were discussed last week and again this week. The discussion was more about her life and how her paper can discuss its relevance to her childhood and to how she might use the book’s content in her future.
The concept- ‘theory of mind’ was discussed again in tonight’s session. “This was used to inform each of the 13 key actions of parents who raise mentally strong- resilient children. The book is Thirteen Things Mentally Strong Parents Don’t Do by Amy Marin. Once theory of mind was used to evaluate the book- chapter by chapter- the assignment took on meaningful characteristics and made the book worth reading. Theory of Mind (ToM) was discussed in detail and Saniaa will keep this concept in mind as she reads the book for this assignment.” Saniaa will use ToM as a primary focus of this paper.

1. What did you do? 
The SOC 248 assignment was another 500-word- one-page writing piece. This is about racial stereotypes seen in TV shows and in film.  Time was spent reviewing the required chapter material (5) and discussing the main points and locating examples in media that fit the assignment. The concepts were a ‘new racism’- white savior complex- and meritocracy. Today’s session key concepts included white supremacy- segregation- inequality- systemic racism- systemic inequality- social norms- power differential and inequality. The two films used were Stand and Deliver and Hidden Figures. Rather than a nostalgic view of a past time- both films confronted racism - educational- systemic and individual.
Zeynep had two responses from the professor. This was taken into account as she wrote the current essay. The responses were as follows: write as an essay in essay format and elaborate using content from the text. Both were accomplished in the current essay.

The 500-page analytical reflection is challenging and Zeynep struggles- to some extent- with English and a more academic vocabulary in English. This assignment is due Sunday. There is a change in SOC 248 writing assignments. There will no longer be the short (300 word) writing assignment but there will continue to have the 500-word one-page paper due weekly. These 500 word essays will be 80% of the final grade for this class.

New grades were reported and recorded tonight.

1. What did you do? 
Time was spent discussing working a week ahead of due dates. DJ was interested in this idea.
Initially- DJ asked to answer a question on the HFS 363 assignment. He saw the assignment as having one question left to complete and someone wanted to work with him on this assignment. Time was spent reviewing how the data ‘told a story’ which was the point or one reason this assignment was assigned. The data was discussed and DJ read more of the data details. He was encouraged to define his terms and to try to compare relatively even populations for best results. DJ noted he would need to redo some parts of the assignment. This assignment is due Sept 30 so he has time to complete it.

1. What did you do?
Nea was working on a presentation for the SOC 102 course. The presentation has specific and somewhat narrow criteria which she was following carefully. However- she was concerned she was following the criteria correctly. There were questions about citations including citing the images used for the PowerPoint presentation. The final decision was to use the insert tool in Word-Office 365 which has a choice to use all images from the creative commons or from an open source public record. This allows her to make easier citations for all image choices. 
The professor for the SOC 102 wrote notes to Nea about her first written assignment. He noted grammar but her grammar was fine. Apparently- she did not use the APA format correctly. Several sources were show as possible usage for upcoming papers. Several notable parts of correct citations for APA format were discussed. Examples were located in both Citefast and in Purdue OWL. She forgot to have a cover page- to number her pages- and to have a running heading. It is unclear if the professor was clear in his instructions regarding the APA format. Fortunately- ASA was not required. According to Nea- this professor told her that he cannot understand her when she speaks English. 
Grammarly- Citefast- and Purdue OWL were recommended as support sites. Additionally- Deeple was recommended.

The PHI 107 paper is due next week. It is to be 1200 words. Time was spent discussing and planning the paper. The prompt is about Substance Dualism. The paper due date was pushed back to October 28. Michael reports the prompt has been posted and he printed it. The prompt has the paper requirements and also ‘tips’ for writing a philosophical paper. The intention is to use the prompt requirements as a step by step process for this paper. 
Time was spent reviewing the reading/s and lecture slides about Substance Dualism. Several explanations and definitions in the slides will be used in the paper due next week. Time was also spent discussing the concepts and how the philosophical language could be confusing. The assignment requires Michael to define and construct the theory of Substance Dualism and to include a paragraph that challenges the concept and say why in a reasonable reasoned argument. 
Michael noted he will start by writing bulleted points to use in this paper.

1. What did you do?
Michael had a paper planner with him. He writes his assignments in the planner. He tends to write assignments weekly. Michael reports he likes to do an assignment as soon as it is assigned and he prefers his planner to using an Objective Sheet or his phone.
Michael’s goal for tonight was to write a one-page paper synthesizing two chapters in the ebook for CRS 325. This is the third chapter review assignment- chapters 6 & 7. Michael came in with the bullets already written and ready to write. He noted he would repeat this for the next tutoring session and write several sentence starters for the next paper.
The synthesis for chapters 6 and 7 are due tomorrow by 5 pm. He reports he does not forget due dates- in part- because he completes the assignment when it is assigned. However- he was interested in completing assignments in advance so as to completely finish a part of the required assignments for CRS 325. Michael requested help in reading the assigned chapters and writing a one-page synthesis paper. The first synthesis paper was 70%. Michael noted he would add more writing to the bullets used to write the synthesis of assigned chapters.
Michael reports he did not perform well academically last semester. He also reported that he does not like to read and that he is a skimmer. Michael prefers classes that do require MC tests.
2. Changes in assignment due dates: 
None reported at this time.

3. Updates on assignment completion: 
CRS 325: Public Speaking (text is an ebook)

1.	What did you do?
The proposal submitted for the CRS 325 class was briefly reviewed. Michael added two citations including one from the Onondaga Nation near Syracuse. The first proposal he submitted was a paragraph. The feedback was that the paragraph style was acceptable. He used a paragraph format again but added more information to this proposal. 
Time was spent working on the next synthesis paper. Chapter 8 focuses on delivery and different modes of delivery. Additionally- this chapter will inform the Deliberative Speech which is his next speech. 
Michael continues to use his planner. He has several papers coming in the next few weeks. One is the paper for the PHI course. He was reminded that this paper should be discussed and planned.
Michael’s grade on the PHP exam is 92% and the NAT 105 exam grade is 75%. He had 100% on the MC section but did not elaborate or add details to the short answer questions. He is aware of what to include in the next NAT exam.

1. What did you do?
Saniaa wrote her ides for the first of the five books on the whiteboard so she can organize her ideas for writing ten pages. There were eight themes or ideas that she will use as sections of this paper. The paper is due tomorrow by midnight. She read or is still reading the book and seems to have found it interesting. She will have to focus on this assignment in order to submit it on time.
Saniaa is also taking a course that requires her to read five books and to write five 10-page papers this semester. One paper is slotted for three weeks- one for four weeks- and the other three for two weeks. She is comfortable reading books for a paper and she is comfortable writing 10-page papers. The issue will be planning so she is not up late- impacting her sleep cycle- and so that she is not in the position of pressured writing. This first paper will test her comfort with the timeframe of reading and preparation for writing. The next book is due in two weeks.
There was a discussion about times in her week for academic work. There was also a discussion about planning her Friday timeframe which the most open time she has for academic work. Her schedule also has time slot on Tuesday and Thursdays. The discussion was for Thursdays to include planning for Friday and for Tuesdays to work on Spanish and plan that coursework for the semester. This timeframe is still working for Saniaa. 
Saniaa made 3.8 GPA last semester. She has much to be proud of.

He is almost finished with the first one-page writing assignment and was allowed to submit it late. He has the text and will review pertinent parts to complete the first writing assignment. He is also required to use personal examples that demonstrate ‘atomic habits’ and how to create new- positive- goal-orientate habits. Jaheem reports finding this assignment of interest to him.

1. What did you do?
Sophie is form Australia; she reports being in Syracuse three weeks and that jetlag has ended.
Sophie shared that she is diabetic and has Celiac Disease. She wears a pump and works with a Dietitian. 

Time was spent reviewing her courses and her schedule. Sophie created a document showing her courses and her athletic schedule. This was useful. We identified several times for planning and doing academic work. Tuesdays and Thursdays have a daytime slot that she uses to complete NSD work. The timeslot will also be used for PSY and/or Oceanography. Fridays are a time she can do most of her academic work. She has one class on Friday then has the day to complete academic and plan other academic assignments.
She is taking PSY- Oceanography- Writing 105- and Nutrition. These are the courses that will demand the most time and three are high-detail courses. The Oceanography homework is a paper copy of information- graphic illustrations- and key vocabulary and terms. There was a discussion about using these HWs (similar to Labs) as a study guide for the exam on Sept 18- about nine days from now. This seemed to appeal to Sophie.
Sophie was given sticky notes- pocket folders- writing pads and a notebook. She felt this would useful. Sophie is still finding her way at Syracuse University.
Sophie reports liking to go to be early.

Lax. Sept 21- 2023- 7-8:15pm
1. What did you do?
Michael’s goal for this semester and next semester is to earn a 3.00 GPA. This will allow him to declare a major. Michael was encouraged to think about steps to achieve his goal. He did not have steps in mind but will think about how to get to the 3.00 GPA.
Time was spent printing all of his syllabi and reviewing them in brief. SOC was reviewed first because his first exam is Wednesday- Sept 27S. Michael is less interested in Sociology and reports he does not prefer MC exams. A study plan was discussed in some detail and he agreed to do the plan. The plan is to prioritize SOC- to review the posted pptx and to chunk the material and his time as he reviews the information. Chunking was explained in detail. Michael agreed to try it.
The presentation and paper were also discussed. The rubrics for each were printed. He was reminded that he will need to narrow his topic- the economy and work- for a manageable project. The sources are to be current primary sources from news sources such as news magazines- papers- and journals. Details must be verified. Six sources are the required minimum. The sources can be opinion related sources but they must be reported as opinion.  
Michael has the first test in NAT on Tuesday- Sept 26 a day before the SOC exam. The first PHI paper is due the following week. Additionally- the first part of the BCP is Sept 29.
A Do and Due type of plan will be discussed in the next session. Michael expressed an interest in meeting on Mondays at 7.
Michael reports he did not perform well academically last semester. He also reported that he does not like to read and that he is a skimmer. Michael prefers classes that do require MC tests.

1. What did you do? 
The challenging course for Trey is the SOC 101 course. This course’s assignments are organized in groups and each group is to organize itself for completion of the required prompts. There was a discussion about how to add to a question that another group member answered. He could use something such as- ‘The part of the reading that struck me was…” “and this was an example of ‘natural growth’- ‘concerted cultivation’ or an example of cultural preference in parenting. 
Trey reported that his group project was graded as 50%. The professor’s feedback was reviewed and discussed. The professor’s feedback indicated several important things: the group is almost dysfunctional- several answers missed the main idea- and there were few examples and references to specific parts of the readings. 
The group works so that members each take a question to answer. The first group assignment was answered by members choosing the questions. The answers were general with some wandering around the point and the group members did not use key terms and concepts in sociology noted in the readings. Trey was encouraged to use key terms- note the part of the conversation he is using to develop his answers- to use examples and to elaborate from his examples. The book- They Say- I Say- was used for templates appropriate for college students who are developing their academic writing skills. Trey found the templates useful and understood how phrasing such as- ‘in other words’ could support elaboration. 
Trey reports most of his academic work in the evening after 7:00. He takes a short break then does his academic work. Trey noted he sometimes uses the kitchen table but has started going into his room and closing the door for better concentration.

1. What did you do?
Jaheem completed the NSD 205 online HW before tonight’s session. He reported being ‘caught up’. Time was spent discussing several athletes who performed in early Olympics and the NSD225 material for the upcoming Midterm exam. The purpose was to attach real-life examples of nutritional knowledge and how the exam questions will focus on the application of the information of the course.
Time was spent discussing study strategies and exam preparation for the NSD 225 exam. It was suggested he review the NSD material for 15 minutes in the evenings as one study strategy to repeat four times weekly. This can prevent stressful exam preparation. He is aware there will be a Study Guide for NSD and that the guide will be available very close to the exam.
One new grade was reported.
Jaheem reports that his other classes are going well.

1. What did you do?
Jaheem brought his binder to tutoring.
Tomorrow’s assignment for PPE 325 was printed and added to the binder. The assignment is via email. The BB course for PPE does not open. The professor may not use BB. The textbook- Successful Coaching- was located online. Jaheem was reluctant to use the online book. It appeared to be a free pdf download and the textbook itself is old enough that this is possible. Jaheem emailed the professor to let him know the text was ordered but not yet in the bookstore. He does not have the hard copy textbook. The second textbook for this course is Mind Gym by Gary Mack. This book did not appear to be available to download; however- a book review by the author was located. Jaheem noted the links for both texts so he can look it up on his own and read it for class discussion. Time was spent discussing what a mind gym was and how it might be applied to coaching. 
The other PPE 325 Textbook was discussed in brief. Successful Coaching could be read online and used for the important class discussion. Class discussion is worth 35% of the grade in the class. Jaheem was advised to email the professor and let him know he made an effort to find enough information to participate in the discussion but he was unsure about the online book and will ask the professor what he should do until the textbook arrives.
Jaheem reported he has a tutor for NSD. He will work with this tutor for the online homework and assignments and asked to review the material in tutoring. 
Jaheem reported that he had all of his textbooks. He meant that he ordered all of his textbooks. However- the two texts for PPE 325 have not arrived and the SU Bookstore does not have them in at this time. Most assignments require the textbook. Jaheem reported that he emailed the professor that the textbooks are not in the bookstore. He did not have a response from the professor.
Time will be spent working on a plan for managing academic work. The other courses will be discussed in the next tutoring session.

1. What did you do? 
The SOC 248 assignment was the 500-page writing piece. This is about racial stereotypes seen in TV shows and in film. Zeynep watches Turkish shows rather than US shows. Time was spent reviewing the required chapter material (5) and discussing the main points and locating examples in media that fit the assignment. The concepts were a new white racism- white savior complex- and meritocracy. The 500-page analytical reflection is challenging and Zeynep struggles to some extent with English and a more academic vocabulary in English. This assignment is due Sunday.

Zeynep asked to meet another time this week. Thursday is a possibility.
No new grades were reported tonight.

1.	What did you do? 
Zeynep asked for support for a Sociology writing assignment and an assignment in the PSY 393 (Personality) course. 
The PSY assignment was a writing assignment based on the book- The Woman Warrior: Memoirs of a Girlhood Among Ghosts by Maxine Hong Kingston. The assignment needed to describe actions by the main character and note behaviors and thoughts that were suggestive of her personality traits.
It was necessary to use examples from the book. This took some time and Zeynep was able to write the required length for the PSY assignment. 
The SOC 248 assignment was the shorter 300-page writing piece. Zeynep was able to complete this assignment. It was about racial microaggressions. She chose to write about microaggressions toward people of the Muslim faith. This was difficult because she is Muslim and thought she might not be able to write with a fair view of microaggressions against Muslins. However- Zeynep was able to write this assignment.

Lax. Sept 28- 2023- 7-8
1. What did you do?
Michael’s goal for this semester and next semester is to earn a 3.00 GPA. This will allow him to declare a major. Michael was encouraged to think about steps to achieve his goal. He did not have steps in mind but will think about how to get to the 3.00 GPA.
Time was spent working on the next synthesis one page HW assignment for CRS 325. Two chapters were to be synthesized- chapters 2 and 12. Both chapters focused on connecting to the audience- the learning that occurs for both the speaker and the audience and the timely focus of the content to the specific audience. This synthesis used his projected role as a volunteer coach of 16 year olds Lacrosse players. In this example- he was able to incorporate both Freire – reflectivity & problem posing- empowerment- community- and connection. Michael was able to use these concepts in this week’s synthesis.
Last session- Michael worked on the BCP and created a family history in the supplied online site. He also worked on the online Personal Wellness Assessment. The family history did not take much time for Michael to complete. The Personal Wellness Assessment (PWA)- on the other hand- took more time to complete. The PWA was almost completed but his MacBook died from lack or charge. Michael completed the part 1 of the BCP. He is ready to submit it and will do so after tutoring by Sept 29 by 5 pm.
Michael reports he feels good about both exams- ‘they went well” – NAT 105 and SOC 102. When grades are posted- there will be an opportunity to analyze what works best as exam preparation for future exams.
A Do and Due type of plan will be discussed in the next session. 
Michael reports he did not perform well academically last semester/last year. He also reported that he does not like to read and that he is a skimmer. Michael prefers classes that do not require MC tests.

Isaiah is an HFS major.  He told me right away that I could be ‘mama’ and ask to see his work and see that it was submitted. He reported that if I asked him if something was reported- he might not give an accurate report. He said this with good humor. 
Time was spent working on the HFS 204 assignment due Thursday- tomorrow- September 21 by midnight. This is a research piece based on a question of interest to Isaiah. He is interested how Black fathers parent and also interested in absentee Black fathers and connections to homelessness. The assignment requires three sources. Isaiah reported preferring using peer reviewed sources. He located the SU library and chose the ProQuest database. He located three academic sources- emailed them to himself- and copied the citations for each. He is using APA format and will be able to work efficiently with the citations already appropriately recorded. 
Time was spent checking each source for type of research- methods- institution supporting the specific research- findings- and limitations. One of the sources was a review of research and will be reported and integrated into his primary question.
Time was also spent briefly reviewing his other course so he is aware of upcoming due dates. Isiah noted he forgot to do the first few assignments of two of his courses. These are noted below. He is also aware that he needs to use a tool to remind him of due dates. He is willing to use his phone for reminders.

1. What did you do? 
DJ has a planning tool that organizes assignments in bars and shows when each are completed and submitted. 
He noted he forgot about tomorrow’s exam in HFS 479. However- he has a classmate who shared her study guide with him. This was in the form of slides that are digital notecards. This study guide was helpful and time was spent reviewing course content in detail. In some cases- acronyms were used for recall. DJ will use tomorrow morning and early afternoon to review the content. He may try repeating the material out loud instead of rewriting the material for recall.
The exam will be evaluated in the next session and there will be a discussion for preparation for the next exam.

We went through each of her professor's expectations- guidelines- course objectives- and assignments. ,Key objectives set during the session were the coursework she needs to complete and catch up on. She was a little behind in some of her classes on readings- and has one late assignment in ENL 207- but she plans to complete it as soon as she gets a chance. She has several introductory assignments and readings due before our next appointment- with a lot of them being due next Monday night. ,Her assignments are just starting to trickle in this week because last week was syllabus week. She is going to submit a couple tonight after her practice that ends at 6:30 pm. ,This is only the second week of classes- so Cato hasn't received any professor feedback on anything yet. ,My only concern is about her one missing assignment in ENL 207- but she confirmed that she will be working on it and submitting it later tonight. She has to catch up on a few readings for HST 111- but she likes the course content and is excited to read. , No,YES

Since she forgot her planner- we spent some time reviewing the assignments she had due. I made a point of talking with her about how even though she put in all the due dates in her planner- some classes don't update their weekly assignments until the beginning of a week or unit. She has a couple of classes like this- so I had her note each of the assignments in her phone to compare to her planner later. After that- she decided to work on her WRT assignment due this week- and I helped her understand how to approach the assignment since it was a very complex analytical assignment. ,Our objectives were to make sure Cherlin knew what she needed to do and get started on the most exigent deadline- which was her WRT assignment (due tomorrow); she also has another 10 page paper for CRS- but she doesn't have the book she needs and we already built an outline for her to use. ,Cherlin started her WRT assignment- but she wasn't able to complete it. However- she said she felt prepared and able to complete it by the end of our appointment. ,She got a 75% on one of her other CRS class essays. We discussed the feedback and how to improve for the next one. She also got a grade for her WRT class- and she did well on that one. ,My only concern is that she doesn't have the book she needs for her CRS 10 page paper due on Thursday (10/5), No,YES

1. What did you do? 
DJ was a bit early tonight. 
DJ reported he completed most of his homework for this week. Time was spent discussing the NSD 205 online homework. He was advised to treat the online HW as preparation for the first exam. This prevents pressured exam prep and supports academic confidence. 
The online HW was discussed. DJ completed the first three sets of online HW for NSD 205. 
DJ created an excel spreadsheet of assignments and their due dates. He marks assignments when completed. He uses this as a management tool for his coursework. He already has the spreadsheet completed for the semester.
Time was spent discussing working a week ahead of due dates. DJ was interested in this idea. This idea is still a possibility.
One concern was that his work schedule may conflict with his tutoring time. Today- DJ reports his schedule will work or tutoring.  He asked about other times he might attend tutoring.

For Wednesday's session we planned to work on his PSY 205 quiz study guide and afterwards he will start his WTL assignment that is due Sunday because he doesn't want to have to do it while he is back home for fall break.

Daijon Richards- Sept 6- 2023 T & F Short Sprinter
1. What did you do? 
DJ was on time. He reported getting permission from his Academic Advisor for a brief check-in because of his work schedule. This was the first meeting with a new student and it was important to have a conversation with him about management of his coursework. DJ is a HFS major. His plan is to attend Grad school for School Psychology and possibly Counseling or Social Work. Then to go to Master’s level grad work for Social Work and after working for seven years- attain his R number and work in a private practice.
 DJ created an excel spreadsheet of assignments and their due dates. He marks assignments when completed. He uses this as a management tool for his coursework. He already has the spreadsheet completed for the semester. Syllabi were printed and put in his binder. His schedule is also in his binder.
Time was spent discussing working a week ahead of due dates. DJ was interested in this idea.
1. The concern is that his work schedule may conflict with his tutoring time. The discussion included the following: 
Is it possible to hold the 6 to 7 pm- Wednesday time slot for tutoring and he would arrive five minutes late and leave 5 minutes early to accommodate his work schedule.
Possible tutoring time moved to Friday at 4. This is acceptable to me. Once again- the 4 to 5 pm time slot would have to be preserved for tutoring but he could arrive late and leave early as noted above. 
2. The second concern is that he might overwork. He was moving close to the speed of light tonight and he has a few notable- ambitious projects- plans leading to an in-service or practicum for the Cap Stone project. Additionally- DJ works and takes as many hours as he can. 
3. There was a discussion about (academics) working a week ahead. This would give him breathing room and protect him from a difficult week which did not work with his excel schedule. Importantly- his plan should include free time to maintain his stress- health- sleep- and performance in his sport. 
2. Changes in assignment due dates: 
None reported at this time.

3. Updates on assignment completion: 
Will attach a list of course work in the next session. He has two online classes.
REL : Sports and Religion (Arnold) online course
NSD 225: Assignment completed to date. This includes online HW and the first assignment- the three-day food log.
Courses will be added in prior to the next tutoring appointment. 
4. Behavior/Struggles/Tardiness: 
Concerns noted above but in terms of his responsibility- there are no concerns.
5. Additional Comments: 
DJ is from New York City. He is a transfer student and a short sprinter – 60 to 200.
Track & Field is in pre-season. Sundays are their day off.
DJ is ahead in his coursework. He is a transfer form Utica and all of his credits transferred.

1. What did you do?
Time was spent discussing study strategies for the upcoming exams- SPM Oct 18 and SOC 102 October 19. Chunking the material with short breaks in between was suggested. This was discussed in detail. The goal of working a week ahead of due dates was discussed. This gives students more control over their weekly assignments and frees them if something is added to their schedule.
Nea reports she has a posted list of assignments and she uses a planner. She crosses off assignments as they are completed and submitted. Nea is a student and has not missed any assignments. 
Grammarly- Citefast- and Purdue OWL were recommended as support sites. Additionally- Deeple was recommended. Nea uses Citation Machine. 
Nea is traveling again next week for several games. 
Nea’s goal for the semester is to pass her current classes and do as well as she can academically. Her other goal is to get better as a player. Nea reports she has played in most games.

While we reviewed this week's objective sheet and Lysander was catching up with some readings he missed- I made a calendar for important due dates in September and October. ,Key objectives that were set were to double-check everything and to catch up on his readings which he has for pretty much every class. He needs to do readings for four of his classes and submit a discussion post before recitation classes on Friday. I think the other IA missed that there are discussion posts but Lysander will submit the ones he missed and make sure he doesn't forget them from now on. ,Nothing was submitted but a good chunk of reading was done in one of his English classes. ,None,Yes- Lysander does not have the book for ENG152 and I took that class. I was going through my things for donation the other week and saw that I still have the textbook that I used for that class. I will no longer be needing it and I was going to donate it but I could pass it on to Lysander. There are no notes/writing in there and it's in good condition.

1.	What did you do?
2.	Oct 13 Orange Tip Off; Orange Magic Oct 21 (6-8 pm); Exhibition Games Oct 28 (% pm on Tuesday)

This week- Sophie has the following due: WRT105 – Sept 19 – submitted NGY- The next WRT 105 Unit is in progress
The OCE grade changed from 87% to 100%.
Time was spent in tutoring discussing the PSY quiz. Sophie completed the study guide for the next PSY quiz. The next PSY test will include parts of the brain- neurotransmitters- neurons- and more high detail information. She was advised to be sure she can sort the neurotransmitters and know conditions associated with them and what treatment matches specific neurotransmitters. 
She reported the recent NSD online HW was very difficult. Her grade was 69% for this HW.
The next group of exams are spread out more than this first group. The dates were discussed in session. Sophie knows how to be a student. She takes notes in class and uses them for exam prep and for HW.
This was reviewed in today’s tutoring: There was a discussion about pacing herself so she does not overdo or over work. She is a student and seems to like her courses. The courses are demanding and require focused and continuing exposure to recall information for her best performance.
This was discussed in today’s tutoring: Sophie is aware that after the first exams- she can determine if she needs to continue the same amount of preparation or be able to reduce her preparation time and perform as well as she did for the first exams. At this point- the primary conversation is maintaining efficiency so Sophie gets what she wants but is not overworking.

Academic Identified Times
•	Sophie uses Sundays to complete most of her assignments especially for assigned HW. WBB games tend to be on Fridays and Sundays. Sundays may not work for academic work once her season begins.  The overall goal is to have all assignments completed by Friday evening. Sundays- if possible- will be when Sophie can check BB and her SU email for any changes in assignments of due dates.
•	Tuesdays and Thursdays have a daytime slot that she uses to complete NSD work. The timeslot will also be used for PSY and/or Oceanography. On Mondays- Sophie has a timeslot from 3:10-5:15. This is still a working plan for completing her academic work and should work when she enters her season. Sophie reports the courses are not too much for her. 
•	The Oceanography homework assignments are to be completed in Recitation so this gives Sophie more time to complete other assignments outside of classes and practice. Both lecture and recitation in Oceanography may be used as exam preparation. This was discussed and reviewed again in session tonight- 9-28-23.
•	Three minutes after class to review her notes while her mind is on the material is a strategy discussed and reviewed again in session. After the three minutes- she is to review this material in the evening for about 15 minutes then do not review it again until the next day. This process fosters recall.

We checked off what he had completed that was due and he showed me that he had turned it in. For the remainder of the 30 minutes he worked on his math assignments. ,The key objectives were to finish homework 7.3 and homework 7.4 for MAT 296. These were due Sunday night but he only did some of 7.3 and clicked the extension option on the homework page. Now he has until the 19th at midnight to finish these two assignments. We also planned for him to study for exam one of his ECS 101 class. Everything else is done. ,Yes from 9/13-9/20 all the assignments that were due have been turned in. This includes CHE 106- CHE 107- and ECN 102. ,He informed me that he went to the office hours of his ECS 101 class because he was having a hard time with two problems and the professor was helpful. ,My only concerns is for his ECS 101 course and MAT 296 courses. He says he understands better what is going on in his ECS course after talking to his professor but he seemed a little hesitant and he does have an exam tomorrow- so I feel like depending on how that goes he might need a tutor for that course.

1. What did you do?
Isaiah is an HFS major. The Research class- HFS 204- has frequent quizzes. The quizzes have five questions. He noted the recent quiz asked about the parts of a research paper and he was able to answer correctly. He has a tutor for the Research course.
 He told me right away that I could be ‘mama’ and ask to see his work and see that it was submitted. He reported that if I asked him if something was reported- he might not give an accurate report. He said this with good humor. 
He started at least one class (HFS 204) late and missed the first assignment/s. Isiah completed the CITI module and completed the assignment.
Time was spent working on the HFS 479 course. Isiah had not looked into this coursework. Time was spent reviewing three assigned articles for Monday’s class. He will write the first of eight one page- single spaced reflection according to the assignment criteria. Isiah took notes on each paper and saw the three ideas/concepts- theories that were is each Reading. He also noted two ideas that were challenging to him. The discussion was how to integrate the three ideas or main points and how to discuss the two challenging ideas or new information. Isiah reports that he is a good writer. If he writes and submits the first paper Monday- he will be able to get all eight papers submitted in time. There are ten options but eight papers are required.
Time was also spent briefly reviewing his other course so he is aware of upcoming due dates.

1. What did you do?
Saniaa apologized for being late to tutoring. She reported being in a SAC meeting and lost track of time. 
Time was spent printing her syllabi. She is taking four courses this semester and this will work well for her as she goes into pre-season and into her season. This will occur around Thanksgiving. 
Saniaa wrote her courses on the whiteboard in the tutor room. She put the upcoming assignments next to each course. She is taking Spanish 101 and time was spent discussing how to manage this course for efficiency but also to manage the high level of detail required for all homework and for the quizzes. 
Saniaa is also taking a course that requires her to read five books and to write five 10-page papers this semester. One paper is slotted for three weeks- one for four weeks- and the other three for two weeks. She is comfortable reading books for a paper and she is comfortable writing 10-page papers. The issue will be planning so she is not up late- impacting her sleep cycle- and so that she is not in the position of pressured writing. 
There was a discussion about times in her week for academic work. There was also a discussion about planning her Friday timeframe which the most open time she has for academic work. Her schedule also has time slot on Tuesday and Thursdays. The discussion was for Thursdays to include planning for Friday and for Tuesdays to work on Spanish and plan that coursework for the semester.
Saniaa made 3.8 GPA last semester. She has much to be proud of.

1. What did you do?
HFS major. Discussed how research is conducted in HFS and Isaiah expressed dislike for how it is performed and possibly used for interpretation. Time was spent reviewing one printed research article which Isaiah reported as being helpful. The research was an academic work in APA format. The format was explained and several sections were explained and reviewed. Isaiah was interested and seemed to see how information was formed from this type of research. The participant responses were self-report. This was discussed and explained that this type of research is not causality but shows patterns that are useful in understanding the question at hand.
He told me right away that I could be ‘mama’ and ask to see his work and see that it was submitted. He reported that if I asked him if something was reported- he might not give an accurate report. He said this with good humor. 
Isaiah completed an Objective Sheet. Time was spent printing syllabi for the Binder. He also printed a copy of his academic calendar. 
He started at least one class (HFS 204) late and missed the first assignment/s. He will email the TA and possibly the professor. The professor is his Advisor. He needs to know if he has to make up the first assignment and how to access the CITI module for completion and to fulfill an assignment. He will email tonight or tomorrow. According to Isaiah- he asked the TA about the Reflection assignment and he referred him to the professor who already left the classroom. Access to the CITI Module did not appear to be on BB.

1. What did you do? 
Zeynep asked for support for a Sociology writing assignment. This is a 500-1000-word assignment about one of the four types of racism – overt- cultural- color-blind- and biological racism. Zeynep chose to write about overt racism and cultural racism. She is required to write information from the textbook- chapter 4- about racism and examples such as microaggressions. There were several prompts and she worked to write at least 500 words.
The second assignment is shorter and she will write this outside of tutoring. Zeynep’s written English is excellent but she tends to be less confident in writing in English.
New grades were added to this report.

Since she didn't have much due this week and felt confident about her other classes- we focused on her questions about WRT grades.,Our main objective was to write an email to her WRT instructor to get some more clarity about (1) how he grades- (2) a conversation they had about a comment he left on an assignment that she couldn't find in order to understand how he gives feedback- and (3) to apologize about a couple of late assignments (they were only late by a couple of minutes) and discuss over email a conversation they'd had about how it would be okay if she submitted a few assignments late. ,In order to write this email- we reviewed all the information and avenues available (i.e.- her syllabus- her google doc assignment submissions- etc.) in order to synthesize all the information into an email.,We reviewed her grades for classes- and everything seemed okay (besides the issues with her WRT class).

1. What did you do?
Time was spent reviewing her courses and her schedule. Sophie created a document showing her courses and her athletic schedule.  Mondays was an added timeslot for academic work. Sophie uses Sundays to complete most of her assignments especially for assigned HW. WBB games tend to be on Thursdays and Sundays. Sundays may not work for any academic work. This was discussed. The overall goal is to have all assignments completed by Friday evening. Sundays- if possible- will be when Sophie can check BB and her SU email for any changes in assignments of due dates.

Tuesdays and Thursdays have a daytime slot that she uses to complete NSD work. The timeslot will also be used for PSY and/or Oceanography. Fridays are a time she can do most of her academic work. She has one class on Friday then has the day to complete academic and plan other academic assignments. On Mondays- Sophie has a timeslot from 3:10-5:15. She uses it for readings and homework. Reading for Soc Problems is probably how Mondays will be used. This is still working plan for completing her academic work and should work when she enters her season. Sophie reports the courses are not too much for her. However- she may drop the PST one-credit class.

The Oceanography homework is a paper copy of information- graphic illustrations- and key vocabulary and terms. There was a discussion about using these HWs (similar to Labs) as a study guide for the exam on Sept 18- about nine days from now. This seemed to appeal to Sophie. These assignments are to be completed in Recitation so this gives Sophie more time to complete other assignments outside of classes and practice. Both lecture and recitation in Oceanography may be used as exam preparation. 

Sophie reports she does not like to write. The WRT 105 course was discussed in some detail. Sophie may be able to do some of the WRT assignments in advance or- at least- early in the assignment. This will benefit her because her exams and tests tend to cluster together. 
Next week- Sophie has the following due: NSD 225-DAP #2 Sept 17; OCE - Sept 18; WRT 105 – Sept 19; PSY 205 – Sept 25-27; SOC 102 – Sept 27. The next two weeks will be more demanding than previous weeks. 
Sophie reports liking to go to bed early. Sophie knows how to be a student. So far- the PSY 205 course is reviewing prior knowledge for Sophie.

DJ’s goal is to improve his GPA. Last semester his GPA was 3.2ish. 
DJ has a planning tool that organizes assignments in bars and shows when each are completed and submitted. He continues to use this tool.
DJ worked on his resume for the Introduction to Internship one-credit course. The resume was reviewed primarily for grammar and he made several changes in capitalizations. 
He has not received a grade for the HFS 474 exam. This is the exam he forgot about and studied in the last session. He noted some of the wording was tricky and realizes he will be able to improve his grade on the upcoming exams and assignments.
Additionally- DJ was reminded to use the NSD 225 weekly online HWs as exam preparation. This was discussed in some detail because he has a goal to improve his GPA this semester.

1. What did you do? 
The SOC 248 assignment was the weekly 500-word- one-page writing piece. The current paper is about colorism as discussed in Sociology. Colorism is within cultures and subgroups within cultures. Passing is an example of colorism within the African and African American cultures and within racism in the US. The assignment stressed colorism as stratification- gendered- and discriminatory. Colorism is an example of a violation of norms for US society and is used to designate status. Zeynep wrote the 500 word essay. There was a focus on specific terminology used in the text. An effort was made to encourage elaboration and the book- They Say- I Say- with its templates was used as suggested language.

Zeynep had two responses from the professor. This was taken into account as she wrote the current essay. The responses were as follows: write as an essay in essay format and elaborate using content from the text. Both were accomplished in the current essay. There are not new responses from the professor to date.

The 500-page analytical reflection is challenging and Zeynep struggles- to some extent- with English and a more academic vocabulary in English. This assignment is due Sunday. There is a change in SOC 248 writing assignments. There will no longer be the short (300 word) writing assignment but there will continue to have the 500-word one-page paper due weekly. These 500 word essays will be 80% of the final grade for this class.

New grades were reported and recorded tonight.

1. What did you do?
Nea was working on ECON homework and asked to review one question in particular. Nea reported that she has to first understand English- then be sure she understands the concept in ECON before completing her homework. The HW is online and she dutifully competes all of her work before it is due. She likes ECON and finds it interesting.
Nea reports that SOC 102 is the most difficult course for her. This is because most of the content is new to her and the textbook readings are lengthy. The last two weeks were very busy and her assignment and test due dates clustered around the same weeks. However- the upcoming week is not as busy for her. 
Time was spent reviewing the ENL 207 assignment. The instructor has mixed APA and MLA formats for this assignment. The Instructor gave specific directions for exactly how she wanted citations to be written which were in APA format but she directed students to name the page- Works Cited. Additionally- the in-text citations are APA but the first page is MLA format. This may be confusing but Nea is following the directions as she should. 
Nea reports she has a posted list of assignments and she uses a planner. She crosses off assignments as they are completed and submitted. Nea is a student and so far has not missed any assignments. 
Grammarly- Citefast- and Purdue OWL were recommended as support sites. Additionally- Deeple was recommended. Nea uses Citation Machine. 
Nea is traveling next week for the first games of the season. She will miss tutoring due to the travel schedule. She is excited to play in the first game.

1. What did you do?
Jaheem was reminded that he has two exams next week NSD 225- October 17 and PPE 325- October 19. He did not seem to think the ‘Coaching’ exam would be demanding. However- he was reminded there are two books in the class and just because he sees this class as relatively easy- he does not need to prepare in advance for the exam. This was acknowledged. 
Time was spent in tutoring preparing for the NSD 225 exam next week. Jaheem had the Study Guide which includes almost everything studied to date. This is typical of NSD 225. It is important that he is studying now to prevent a pressured preparation timeframe.

1.	What did you do?
Oct 13 Orange Tip Off; Orange Magic Oct 21 (6-8 pm); Exhibition Games Oct 28 (% pm on Tuesday)

Sophie had the following due: WRT105 – Sept 19 – submitted 25/25. The next WRT 105 Unit is in progress. The 
Self Portrait assignment is 112/125- 896% There was professor feedback – basically to elaborate in her writing content- to say more and to develop and deepen her ideas.

The OCE exam scored 100%. She is unclear if it was curved. She prepared for this exam similarly to exam #1.
Sophie prepared for the NSD 225 exam #2 as she prepared for exam #1. She did extra credit assignments and answered the Study Guide lists. She reported that this second exam was very hard.
So far- her favorite course is PSY. According to Sophie and in general- the content for NSD is very difficult and requires a lot of memorization. This remains true and she noted that exam #2 was quite hard.
Three courses this semester are high-detail courses requiring a significant amount of memorization- NSD- OCE- PSY. This was discussed as cross-training. Sophie is a confident student.

5. Additional Comments: 
Sophie is from Australia
She is a Small Forward or Power Forward- 3 or 4 positions
1st day of Practice- Sept 26
Practice 7:30-9:30 AM 
Day Off? Saturday
Sophie shared that she is diabetic and has Celiac Disease. She wears a pump and works with a Dietitian. 
Sophie shared that she talks with her mother every other day- every second day. She is “a little” homesick. She was not homesick the first month of school but she is feeling a bit homesick now. She is half way around the world from her family. 

Academic Identified Times
•	Sophie uses Sundays to complete most of her assignments especially for assigned HW. WBB games tend to be on Fridays and Sundays. Sundays may not work for academic work once her season begins.  The overall goal is to have all assignments completed by Friday evening. Sundays- if possible- will be when Sophie can check BB and her SU email for any changes in assignments of due dates.
•	Tuesdays and Thursdays have a daytime slot that she uses to complete NSD work. The timeslot will also be used for PSY and/or Oceanography. On Mondays- Sophie has a timeslot from 3:10-5:15. This is still a working plan for completing her academic work and should work when she enters her season. Sophie reports the courses are not too much for her. 
•	The Oceanography homework assignments are to be completed in Recitation so this gives Sophie more time to complete other assignments outside of classes and practice. Both lecture and recitation in Oceanography may be used as exam preparation. This was discussed and reviewed again in session tonight- 9-28-23.
•	Three minutes after class to review her notes while her mind is on the material is a strategy discussed and reviewed again in session. After the three minutes- she is to review this material in the evening for about 15 minutes then do not review it again until the next day. This process fosters recall.

1. What did you do? 
The challenging course for Trey continues to be the SOC 101 course. There are two extra-credit assignments offered in this course. Trey decided to do the assignment that requires qualitative research in the form of observation. The assignment was reviewed in detail. It must include the Sociological Imagination by C. Wright Mills. The prompt noted “at least two robust paragraphs”. The Sociological Imagination was reviewed and specific language was noted- such a personal problems and public- community- or national and historical troubles. Examples were discussed. 
Additionally- the important to observations being a list of reporting with no interpretations was emphasized as critical to doing this assignment. Patterns will emerge after he has the long list of observations with ascribed identities. The list must be done in a minimum of 45 minutes in a space/place where people congregate. No names or people of places can be used. He will probably use Shine. He is to observe and make notes. Ascribed identities are to be part of the three-four page paper. He is to use APA format and this was noted. It was suggested he use Citefast as a citation tool because he can use lecture notes as a resource. He was reminded to have a cover page- a References page- and the body of the paper. All information was reviewed and the detailed prompt was discussed.
Micro Econ was discussed. e next exam is October 26. Trey was reminded that there are four Labs offered during the week. There was one or two times he could attend. 
In tonight’s sessions- Trey was reminded about the strategies: A brief amount of time was spent discussing academic strategies that are efficient so Trey has more control over his time. He has an excellent memory and this serves him well for exams. The Sports Management course first exam grade was 69%. He speculates his grade was better on the MC part of the exam. He was reminded to elaborate and use examples on the short answer part of the exam. 
This has not changed. Trey reports most of his academic work in the evening after 7:00. He takes a short break then does his academic work. He has more time on Fridays to do academic work. Trey noted he sometimes uses the kitchen table but has started going into his room and closing the door for better concentration. 
New grades were reported and recorded.

1. What did you do? 
Zeynep reported being caught up with assignments in the SOC 248 course. 
The grades for this SOC course are improving. This class requires a lot of writing focusing on racism in the US. Zeynep is using the online text and finding the connections required in the assignment papers. 

Zeynep reports the writing for PSY 393 is easier for her and that her grades are improving. 

For the SOC of Sports course- Z reports the class conversation is about American Football- Baseball- and professional sports’ teams. There appears to be conversations about the professor’s favorite teams. She is not interested in this content and finds the class lecture connection to Sociology weak. 

Zeynep is frustrated with the WRT 205 Instructor’s lack of feedback prior to the due dates of assignments. There are a number of short assignments with no feedback and only a grade on the Unit. She does not know if she is meeting expectations and is concerned that the entire course will be one of not knowing expectations and not being able to perform as well as she could if she had feedback from the Instructor. This course will become a focus in tutoring as new longer writing assignments are posted.

New grades were reported and recorded tonight.

1.	What did you do?
Michael reported being tired because he stayed up to watch a film for the NAT course. He then wrote two pages for the current assignment. His parents are here for the scrimmage this weekend. He was excited about them being here and about the upcoming scrimmage. 
Time was spent writing upcoming assignments in his planner. 
The PHI 107 paper is due October 28. It is to be 1200 words. The paper’s due date was pushed back to October 28. Michael asked to work on this paper next week in both sessions. He has two exams/tests next week- one in NAT 105 and the other in PHI107 He asked for a tutor for both classes so he can be prepared for both exams. 
Tonight he chose to work on the CRS 325 course. The chapters for the current synthesis paper are 3 and 9 and discussed persuasive speeches. The focus was on pathos- logos- and ethos- the social construction of reality- and troupes. It was also on language choices and figures of speech that are effective in an oral- verbal presentation such as a public speech. Michael struggles with the content in the CRS text. It is lengthy and somewhat academic.

1.	What did you do?
Saniaa came to tutoring wearing a boot. She reported being in pain and unhappy about being out of practice. She is now beginning the process of transitioning back to pre-practice activities.

The current book for the CRS 388 is The New Science: Discovering Order in a Chaotic World by Margaret Wheatly. Saniaa has a process she uses for her 10-page papers. She reads the book- makes a diagram of key parts- concepts- and thinks about it. When she starts to write- she has complete sentences and correct grammar. Although this is somewhat pressured writing- it works for her. She plans to read this next book on the bus ride to UCONN this weekend.
The second Spanish quiz was last week. Saniaa reports getting the hang of the Spanish grammar accent marks which are different from English. She also notes having to recall that modifying words are after the noun which can be awkward. However- she reports the recent quiz was challenging and did not perform as well as on the first quiz. Saniaa makes some notecards and uses them to study for exams. She studies the conjugation tables by rereading out loud and practices writing the verbs. She has already started preparing for next week’s exam.
Saniaa has a scrimmage this coming weekend. The team leaves Friday (bus ride to UCONN) and the scrimmage is on Saturday. There is an exhibition game on Tuesday. She plans to read the next book while going to UCONN. 
Saniaa made 3.8 GPA last semester. Saniaa’s goal for this semester is to achieve a 3.9 GPA. 
New grades were reported in tonight’s session. See below.

1.	What did you do? 
DJ received an email from Dr. Arnold regarding the recent assignment in the REL 103 course. The recent writing assignment was about the 1936 Olympics and Riefenstahl’s film Olympia (1938) and the 2008 Olympics in Beijing- China. TurnItIn found a 96% compatibility and prompted Dr. Arnold’s email to DJ. DJ has not received anything similar to this in his time at SU and was surprised by the similarities found in the AI tool TurnItIn. This matter is resolved. Dr. Arnold graded the original written piece. 

DJ worked on an assignment for the HFS 363 course. There was a grid of influences and barriers to use as he assessed the criteria regarding racism in the military during WW2.
DJ reported that the NSD 225 Exam #1 grade was 50%. He reported that the exam was difficult. 
DJ had notes for the upcoming exam in HFS 474. Time was spent reviewing key concepts. This will need to be reviewed again for best results. DJ did not recall definitions quickly and did not have examples of them. He will need to spend more time to prepare for this exam.

This was reviewed in session to prevent the grade he received on the HFS 474 exam. 
“Time was spent discussing chunking his study time with short breaks in between each chunk of study time. The process would be something such as the following: 20 minutes study- 3 minutes off- 15 minutes study- 2-3 minutes off- 10 minutes study- 1-2 minutes off. Take a break of a couple of hours and repeat the process. In other available timeslots- study or review for about 3 to 5 minutes with his mind on the material and in the evening about 15 to 20 minutes that is a read- write- say- and record high detailed content. Note cards is an option to use for this type of exam preparation. “

Lax. Oct 25- 2023
1.	What did you do?
Michael completed the synthesis paper for chapters 3 & 9 in CRS 325. He added a culminating paragraph to wrap up his ideas. He submitted this assignment. His overall grade in this class is 65%. He believes the professor gives him lower grades because his political opinions are different from the professor’s political opinions. 
Time was spent reviewing the assignment prompt for the PHI 107 paper on substance dualism. There are five sections to the paper. He is to argue for substance dualism after he explains what it is and gives an example. The explanation is- in part- the ‘if – then’ statement of substance dualism. He wrote the explanation using (feeling pain) as an example. He wrote the ‘if then’ formula for a logical argument and will need to complete the paper by Friday. 
This course and the paper on substance dualism are challenging for Michael. In fact- the paper using logic and the formula for a logical argument seems difficult for him. However- Michael has the ability to make a logical argument- he is simply unused to doing so. He has been asked to remain clear and to be careful with language in the paper and to think strictly logically as he writes each sentence. The course pptx lecture notes are used as reference for the paper. Michael is using the ppt notes to evaluate the argument for substance dualism according to Descartes’ Meditations. 

Michael has two exams/tests this week- one in NAT 105 and the other in PHI107 on October 24. Michael reported that he has been studying for both exams. Michael feels he did well on both exams.

CRS Proposal: Electronic Cars should be Mandatory - persuasive speech– written on his own- with sources and submitted the proposal. He reports this professor/instructor does not like him because of his political beliefs. Michael sees this as one reason his grades are low in this class.

Michael was hungry during tutoring. He reports he is on a diet so he will be faster than he is now. He reported he is fast but he wants to be faster for the upcoming season. He was distracted because he was hungry.

1. What did you do?
For the HEA class- Jaheem watched a Ted Talk about fidelity in relationships. The concept is about taking responsibility for one’s own ideas and actions of and in love and trust. There was a discussion about entitlement and personal desires as they affect intimate relationships.
Jaheem reported his grade for DAP #4 is 100%.
There was a discussion about preparing for the NSD 225 final exam. The goal is to start now and to review about 30 minutes daily or in the evening three nights a week. The purpose is to keep the information fresh. Jaheem seemed to agree with this idea. His other grades in NSD are very good but the Midterm grade was a failing grade.

There is a concern that Jaheem is not preparing for assignments enough and enough in advance. This will be explored in the next session. This was discussed. Jaheem acknowledged that he has time to prepare for exams and that he will make changes so he is doing this in advance so there is not push just prior to the exam. This is- in particular- relevant to the NSD 225 course content.

1. What did you do? 
Trey was on time and prepared for tutoring. Trey reported that he lost his iPad last week on Thursday. He thought it was at a teammate’s house but it was not. He disconnected it from his Apple account. His cell phone located the iPad in the middle of the road on South Campus yesterday. When he looked- it was not there. His name was not on the iPad.

The ECON test #2 grade is 80%. Trey has a good visual memory and is a strength when preparing for exams. 

There was a discussion about Trey’s grades in SPM. To date- his exam grades are in the C range. The writing assignments tend to have high grades but the first exam was 69% and his overall grade is 72%. This class exams can be sleepers and can take a student by surprise. If Trey can keep his grades in the B range for his classes- except for the SOC 101 course- he should have a reasonable GPA for this semester. The SOC 101 course remains a concern and the belated feedback from the professor about his coursework is problematic.
There was an extended discussion about starting preparation early before the Study Guide is posted but with strategic targeting of obvious material that could easily be on the exam. This would include the guest speakers and the content of their lecture and the assigned articles in the Sports Journal- subscription required. Trey noted this information was on the first exam. He does not have the textbook for this class and does not have a textbook scholarship. 

There is no feedback from the SOC 101 Professor regarding the missing group member and the last group assignment.

1. What did you do?
There was a discussion about the HEA 332 course. Assignments are due Saturday and since the course is asynchronous- he tends to forget assignments until Friday afternoon and rushes the assignments. Putting a reminder in his phone was suggested.

Time was spent discussing the Term Paper requirements and due dates for EXE 435. This is a five page paper- APA style- with clear expectations for grammar and peer reviewed sources. Jaheem is starting rather late for this assignment. The due date for the outline was pushed back but it is unclear if the paper’s due date of November 2 is also pushed back. The outline is an abbreviated annotated bibliography not to exceed one full page. 
Time was spent using ProQuest to locate peer-reviewed sources for the term paper. Jaheem located three sources and emailed them to himself. He will read them by Wednesday so he can start and maybe complete the outline for this assignment. He will need at least five sources for this paper and will need to locate additional sources. 

This is still a concern: There is a concern that Jaheem is not preparing for assignments enough and enough in advance. This will be explored in sessions. This was discussed. Jaheem acknowledged that he has time to prepare for exams and that he will make changes so he is doing this in advance so there is not push just prior to the exam. This is- in particular- relevant to the NSD 225 course content.

1. What did you do? 
Zeynep’s eyes were irritated in tutoring tonight. The tutoring room lights were adjusted to lower the light and hopefully reduce any eyestrain.

There is one availability on Thursday evening at 7 pm. 
 
Zeynep worked on the SOC 248 course assignment. The current assignment is about the difference between wealth and income and the historic racial barriers that contribute to a gap in wealth between whites and blacks in the USA. Examples are to be used in this assignment. The assignment has three parts. Each part must be answered with detailed examples. Intext citations are to be used. Zeynep used the text and started the assignment.

1.	What did you do?
Michael completed the PHI 107 paper and submitted it during tutoring. He asked the professor for a short extension and was granted it. 
Time was spent reviewing the assignment prompt for the CRS 325 synthesis paper. The current synthesis paper is based on chapter 10. This chapter included fallacies in logic. It also included inductive- deductive- and casual types of logic and the responsibility of the speaker to the audience as it concerns conclusions and the use of logic. Michael worked to write this paper and saved it. He will submit it by Friday- the due date. 

Michael has an exam for SOC 101 on Friday. He reports he is or will be ready for the exam. 
On November 3- Part 3 of the BCP is due. Michael noted this will not be a problem and he knows what to do for this assignment. To date- the grades in PHP 121 is an A+. If he continues this level of work- he will have an A in this class. 
This is desirable because the CRS 325 class is challenging for him. Grades for several assignments have not been posted. The persuasive speech outline is due Nov 5. Michael’s topic is electronic cars. 
Michael has a busy week with numerous assignments due. He has cancelled Thursday’s tutoring because he has a job.

2. Changes in assignment due dates:

Michael is a Middy on the SU Men’s Lacrosse team. He is from Long Island and is a sophomore. Michael had to host two recruits who are here to see the SU program and team. 
Michael had a paper planner with him. He writes his assignments in the planner. He tends to write assignments weekly. Michael reports he likes to do an assignment as soon as it is assigned and he prefers his planner to using an Objective Sheet or his phone.
Practice and/or Training/Lift: 
11:30-1:30 (in season)

Michael’s goal for this semester and next semester is to earn a 3.00 GPA. This will allow him to declare a major. Michael was encouraged to think about steps to achieve his goal. He did not have steps in mind but will think about how to get to the 3.00 GPA.

1. What did you do?
Time was spent discussing the Term Paper requirements and due dates for EXE 435. This is a five page paper- APA style- with clear expectations for grammar and peer reviewed sources. The paper is due November 28. The outline is an abbreviated annotated bibliography not to exceed one full page.
 
The due dates for this assignment continue to be confusing. It appears the Outline is or was due 10/29. The paper isn’t due until Nov 28. In addition- there is a short presentation that accompanies the term paper and it is due Nov 2. These dates are on the syllabus but Jaheem reports the dates were all pushed back. Jaheem will check the due dates tomorrow in class. Jaheem will continue reading the sources located in the previous tutoring session. 
Time was spent watching two videos about addiction and two theories of addiction. Jaheem will write a response about these videos and post it in advance of the Saturday due date. 

This is still a concern: There is a concern that Jaheem is not preparing for assignments enough and enough in advance. This will be explored in sessions. This was discussed. Jaheem acknowledged that he has time to prepare for exams and that he will make changes so he is doing this in advance so there is not push just prior to the exam. This is- in particular- relevant to the NSD 225 course content.

1.	What did you do? 
DJ worked on the notes for the HFS 474 course. The exam is pushed back a week. His notes were the same as the last tutoring session but today he made Quizlet cards to foster recall. Specific examples of key terms were discussed in detail. He was advised to write key terms side by side to see the differences which supports MC questions. MC questions are not his natural strength; however- short answers to questions is a strength. 

 “Time was spent discussing chunking his study time with short breaks in between each chunk of study time. The process would be something such as the following: 20 minutes study- 3 minutes off- 15 minutes study- 2-3 minutes off- 10 minutes study- 1-2 minutes off. Take a break of a couple of hours and repeat the process. In other available timeslots- study or review for about 3 to 5 minutes with his mind on the material and in the evening about 15 to 20 minutes that is a read- write- say- and record high detailed content. Note cards is an option to use for this type of exam preparation. “

1. What did you do? 
Trey was on time and prepared for tutoring. The overall goal this semester is for all classes to have grades as high as possible to mitigate the possibility of a low or lower SOC 101 grade. 

Time was spent examining upcoming exams and assignments’ due dates. Time was focused on preparation for exams in SOC 101 and SPM 205. The discussion included interval studying such as chunking material especially on the evenings he does not have that particular class.
The plan for the SPM exam this Thursday is as follows: This was reviewed in session tonight and Trey likes the plan and started the review as noted below.
Sunday- Nov 5 – 
Review the amount of material to be on this exam
Decide when during the week he will review content 
Decide how much time is needed to adequately cover the material
Review the Guest Speaker’s notes
Review the posted power points
This plan was appealing to Trey. 
Time was spent writing a rough schedule for the next two weeks and when he can prepare for the SPM exam and the SOC 101 Group Assignment #3.

The preferred plan for Monday’s tutoring hour is as follows:
Review his plan for preparation for the SPM 205 exam on Thursday – this was done
Review the current assigned Readings for SOC 101. There was no time to review the Readings. However- the new group assignment was reviewed and discussed. He was reminded to use the sociological imagination for Part 1. 
Trey is required to watch the documentary Inequality for All. It is an Amazon Prime movie and is 1.5 hours in length. This film is about the growing gap between the middle class and the wealthy. The key concepts ae stratification and financial inequalities.
Use the review of the assigned Readings as exam preparation for SOC 101. There continues to be minimal feedback from the SOC 101. For the group assignment and the missing group member- there is now a grade- 81%. Exam #2 has not been graded. In Grades- the exam shows as needing to be graded. 

There was a discussion about Trey’s sleep patterns. He freely shared that he doesn’t get to sleep until around 1 AM and is on the phone for a few hours prior to 1 AM. It was noted that college students typically do not get enough sleep and Trey reports that he naps and this mitigates his fatigue. However- the discussion was about his ability to perform athletically in the way he wants to perform and that next semester- more sleep is most likely desirable. The discussion included making small changes in sleep habits. Trey engaged in the conversation.

When I asked what class- it was his HFS class- which I was confused about. Every IA session- I would remind him of the assignments he had to do and asked him if he was keeping up with the ones he had from the previous. He would always say yes that he turned them in- only occasionally explaining when he missed an assignment. During sessions- he would work on his homework for other classes typically- but I would always remind him about his upcoming assignments in that class and ask him about them the following week. He said he wanted to withdraw because he had a lot of late assignments that he couldn't make up- therefore I am unsure if he was not telling the truth when he would say he did his assignments. Additionally- he was provided an assignment tracker at the beginning of the semester- online and a hard copy- to keep track of these assignments so that he would not fall behind. ,Yes,YES

1. What did you do?
Michael was on time and prepared. He took the third test in the NAT course. According to Michael- the professor told him he did well but no grade has been posted to date. Part 3 of the BCP has not been graded. Exam two in this class is 98%. The final in this course is Part 4 of the BCP. 

The CRS 325 class is challenging for Michael. The next speech is a ceremonial speech. Michael still plans to do an Awards Speech about himself. Michael wrote the proposal for the Ceremonial speech over the break. He will write the outline by Wednesday. The Speech itself is due next week.

The plan for after Thanksgiving is to spend tutoring time on the second PHI paper. Unfortunately- the prompt is still not posted; this paper is due Dec 12- the day of the final in this class and the day of the final in the NAT 105 course.
Michael is aware that it is imperative to stay strong to the end and to push to get the most out of his academic effort as possible in all courses.

Michael is a Middy on the SU Men’s Lacrosse team. He is from Long Island and is a sophomore. Michael had to host two recruits who are here to see the SU program and team. 
Michael had a paper planner with him. He writes his assignments in the planner. He tends to write assignments weekly. Michael reports he likes to do an assignment as soon as it is assigned and he prefers his planner to using an Objective Sheet or his phone.

11:30-1:30 (in season)

Michael’s goal for this semester and next semester is to earn a 3.00 GPA. This will allow him to declare a major. Michael was encouraged to think about steps to achieve his goal. He did not have steps in mind but will think about how to get to the 3.00 GPA.

1. What did you do?
Time was spent discussing all of her classes and the upcoming assignments. Nea reports she has done all available extra-credit assignments for the semester. There are biweekly short writing assignments worth a point each. She has completed all of these. These short writing assignments may be used as attendance and are worth one point each. She was reminded that when extra-credit is offered- the total possible amount of points may not be earned but some part of the total may be earned.
Nea has completed most of this semester’s assignments. The FYS course is complete. She has a handful of assignments to do before the end of the semester. Reviewing her grades- she may have one B but her other grades look to be in the A range. Nea has much to be proud of.
Time was spent working on the final assignment for ENL course. The assignment is to write a cover letter and resume. 
Dr. Adamo talked with Nea about qualifying for extended time since she is an ENL student. She expects to hear from him regarding this for the final exam. However- 
Dr. Adamo did not get back to Nea about qualifying for extended time for the final exam. She was referred to her Academic Coordinator to consult with her about extended time for exams. The reason for extended time is because her first language is Finnish and her exams are in English.
Nea reports getting used to being ‘in-season’ and in college at the same time. 

“Nea declared her major to be Sports Management and has chosen classes for next semester.
Nea reports she has a posted list of assignments and she uses a planner. She crosses off assignments as they are completed and submitted. Nea works week to week for most assignments although she is aware of due dates further ahead than a current week. 
Nea is a focused student and has not missed any assignments. In addition- Nea does extra credit assignments when they are available. She is doing college level work in a language that is not her first language. She was shown They Say- I Say in tutoring tonight. This is a source with sentence starters that often foster elaboration and support developing a formal academic writing voice.  Grammarly- Citefast- and Purdue OWL were recommended as support sites. Additionally- Deeple was recommended. Nea uses Citation Machine. 
The team traveled Thanksgiving week. There were two matches.
Nea’s goal for the semester is to pass her current classes and do as well as she can academically. Her other goal is to get better as a player. Nea reports she has played in most games. Nea studies at the end of the day and likes to finish by 8 or 8:30. She tends to go to bed by 10 PM. Nea reports that she feels better and is able to perform better when she is reasonably rested.”

1. What did you do? 
Trey was on time and prepared for tutoring.

The MC grade on this exam was 100% and he is thinking the short answer questions should be in the A range.

The SPM 205 PowerPoint is due today by midnight. Time was spent in tutoring working on this assignment. Trey reported completing the assignment in tutoring. 

Grades were updated in the previous tutoring session. There are no new grades today.  
Trey registered for next semester. He registered for five classes. Macro ECON- REL & Sports (Arnold)- SPM 225- WRT 205- one more will be added. He is hoping to add Psychology to his schedule.

We also talked about her religion class where she was trying to determine if she needed to complete a supplementary 10 page essay. The essay was only assigned to make up work for those who had more than 3 absences in the class- but Cherlin wasn't sure if that meant her or not. I encouraged her to talk to her instructor about it (since he doesn't check emails). Cherlin was also trying to make a decision about whether she would take the final exam or final paper (the instructor gave a choice) in her CRS class. Despite deciding to do the test- Cherlin asked if we could work on an outline for the final paper just in case she changed her mind later. After helping her with that- she continued with her other goals for the session. ,Our key objectives were for her to finish her discussion post (which she did) since that was due at 3PM today- and to get organized with her WRT paper. For next time- I asked that Cherlin complete the WRT outline. That way we can focus on organization and primarily MLA formatting because this was where Cherlin lost the most points in her previous essays for the class. ,Cherlin finished her discussion post and worked on her outline.,Cherlin got a 95% on her influencer simulation in CRS with great feedback from the instructor.,No, No,YES

1. What did you do? 
Trey was on time and prepared for tutoring. Trey’s grades were reviewed. He is aware and motivated to perform as well as possible for his final assignments. Trey improved his performance in most assignments. In some assignments- his improvement was a significant increase.

SPM should be his lowest grade due to two early missed assignments. The SOC 101 course will drop the lowest exam grade so this class could be a B or B+. FYS will be an A as long as he submits the three missed assignments. ECON should be in the B range. WRT still shows one grade which is 100%; the second project has not been graded or posted. However- this course should be good grade for Tray.

There was a discussion about organization of coursework and due dates for next semester. He will be in-season and organization for assignment due dates will make his semester manageable. He forgot a few early assignments this semester for two courses and these early missed assignments reduced his grades. The goal for next semester is to work a week ahead of all due dates. This will benefit his Lacrosse schedule and keep his grades in a respectable range. Trey seemed to like this idea. It is clear that once he is in-season- his mind will be on his sport. 

Next semester- Trey has one class on Mondays at 9:30 AM and all other classes are on Tuesday- Wednesday- and Thursday. There are no classes on Friday. This benefits his travel schedule. 
His Lacrosse schedule was discussed and printed. There are a few mid-week games that could create problems and the month of March- due to traveling and midweek games- looks quite hectic for students.

Grades were updated during tonight’s session. 
2. Changes in assignment due dates: 
None reported

3. Updates on assignment completion: 
FYS: Total Grade to date: 134/160 83% but weighted to 85% (forgot one class & woke up late) Grade was reduced because he missed two classes. The overall grade was 100%. This grade is improving and increased to 84%. He was ‘dinged’ for not participating because he missed one class. All other participation grades are 3/3. Monday is the final class.

1. What did you do?
Jaheem was on time and prepared for tutoring. 
The term paper assignment for EXE 345 is due tomorrow by midnight. Jaheem’s topic is Marcus Rashford who is a British professional footballer playing for Manchester United. Jaheem located five journal articles about mental stress experienced by profession athletes such as Rashford. Jaheem copied the citations from ProQuest into his draft and will format the References- the title page- and the paper in APA format. Jaheem was reminded to use APA citation format. He was also reminded to use Citefast as a tool for the title page and paper. Jaheem noted he would do this. 
Jaheem also located an online interview in which Marcus Rashford discussed the mental stress he experienced as a professional athlete and how he managed his stress. The term paper will use Marcus Rashford as an example of an athlete’s struggle with mental stressors and will suggest management strategies from sport psychology and sport science.
 Jaheem has written three and a half pages. He reports the professor is asking for four written pages and additional pages for citations and the title page. Jaheem will need to add in-text citations. There are typical writing errors especially errors with tense and subject-verb agreement. These were noted in tutoring and Jaheem realized he made errors due to writing quickly. He is aware he has more to do on this paper and that it should not be submitted as is. 

He is aware of the organization and format required by this assignment. This includes the APA format style.

1. What did you do?
Michael was on time and prepared. 
He worked on the Outline for the Ceremonial Speech. The outline grade is 10/10. He has one more synthesis paper due Dec 15. The chapter is unclear but Michael expects to write this synthesis paper outside of tutoring because the PHI paper will take more time in tutoring.
The second PHI paper is due Dec 12. The prompt is just now available. The prompt was reviewed and discussed. The lecture slide set on identity and death were reviewed and discussed. There were about 100 slides. Michael will review the slides and decide which argument he wants to argue. The suggested outline in the prompt will be followed to be sure all aspects of the assignment are followed. This will be a time consuming paper. The paper is to be 1200 to 1500 words. This is about five double-spaced pages- APA format- and 12 pt. font.

1. What did you do?
Jaheem was prepared for tutoring. There was a final review of all coursework and final due dates and preparation for exams.
The HEA 332 course has a final paper that includes reflection about unhealthy behaviors that he is thinking about changing and that he is not ready to change. Additionally- he is to write about behaviors he has already changed. The two to four page paper is due December 15 and is worth 15 points. If Jaheem does well on this paper- he could have an A in this class. Jaheem was reminded that the due date is this Friday. The HEA course’s final assignment includes reflection about healthy behaviors. 

Time was spent reviewing for the NDS exam. The NSD exams are long- about 60 MC questions- and studying requires time. It appeared his overall grade in NSD changed to 70%. The grade was higher before today. 
How to study for the final Nutrition exam was reviewed in detail. It is important that Jaheem pass the final in this course. The final is not cumulative. Jaheem has a tutor for this course. He reported he was doing the Extra-Credit Modules as a study strategy. The lowest DAP grade will be dropped. If Jaheem can pass the final- his grade will significantly improve. Jaheem committed that he would do all of the extra credit modules in order to remember enough of the material to pass the final Nutrition exam. Jaheem reports he started studying for the final exam.

Jaheem is taking three courses next semester. He has classes are on Tuesday- Wednesday- and Thursday. He expects to travel on Wednesdays or Thursdays next semester. He does not have classes on Mondays or Fridays next semester.

1. What did you do? 
Trey’s classes and grades were reviewed for the last time this semester. He has a meeting with the WRT Instructor tonight at 5 PM to discuss the final project which is Project #3. As of today- December 11- Project #2 has not been graded. At this time- there is no feedback about Project 2.

FYS is an A. He submitted the three missed assignments. The final grade for this course is posted. Course completed.

SPM should be his lowest grade due to two early missed assignments.
ECON should be in the B range. WRT still shows one grade which is 100%; the second project has not been graded or posted. Trey has a meeting with the WRT Instructor Monday. This is to plan and discuss the final writing assignment. It is an inquiry based paper/project due December 15.

The SOC course does not have a final exam date posted. The SOC 101 course will drop the lowest exam grade (38%) so this class could be a B or B+. Trey texted a classmate to be sure he hasn’t missed an announcement about the final exam. The exam opens the 17th and closes the 18th. 
Trey plans to go home tomorrow. He will take three exams at home. There was a discussion about studying in chunks of time instead of an all afternoon session. Trey is aware the final exams in his course are pivotal in achieving a higher GPA and higher grades in general. It will be difficult to focus on exams once home. Trey is aware the final exam in SOC 101- SPM- and ECON are important to having a higher GPA. 

Next semester- Trey has one class on Mondays at 9:30 AM and all other classes are on Tuesday- Wednesday- and Thursday. There are no classes on Friday. There are no 8 AM classes. This benefits his travel schedule. 
His Lacrosse schedule was discussed and printed. There are a few mid-week games that could create problems and the month of March- due to traveling and midweek games- looks quite hectic for students.

Grades were updated during tonight’s session. 
2. Changes in assignment due dates:

1. What did you do?
Michael was on time and prepared. 
Time was spent creating an organized plan for the second PHI paper which is due tomorrow- Tuesday- Dec 12. The prompt was reviewed again and discussed again in tutoring tonight. The lecture slide set on identity and death was used to guide the logic of Michael’s argument for this paper.
Michael decided to argue the affirmative for “Can we survive the death of our bodies?” The prompt suggested an organization and specific language to use in the argument. Terms such as material and immaterial were used and defined in the beginning of this paper. 
An introduction was written but the argument will take time to write as Michael decides his thinking for the final reasoned argument to defend his idea. He will need to argue the affirmative and defeat the negative view. Bullet points and paragraphs were sketched. Additional time will be needed for elaboration of the ideas used to reason for personal identity and the mind (we) outliving the body.

This will be a time consuming paper. The paper is to be 1200 to 1500 words. This is about five double-spaced pages- APA format- and 12 pt. font. Michael may ask for a short extension. 

One new grade was recorded.

5. Additional Comments: 
Michael is a Middy on the SU Men’s Lacrosse team. He is from Long Island and is a sophomore. Michael had to host two recruits who are here to see the SU program and team. 
Michael had a paper planner with him. He writes his assignments in the planner. He tends to write assignments weekly. Michael reports he likes to do an assignment as soon as it is assigned and he prefers his planner to using an Objective Sheet or his phone.

11:30-1:30 (in season)
The first game is early February

Michael’s goal for this semester and next semester is to earn a 3.00 GPA. This will allow him to declare a major. Michael was encouraged to think about steps to achieve his goal. He did not have steps in mind but will think about how to get to the 3.00 GPA.

1.	What did you do? 
DJ was on time and prepared for tutoring. DJ has always been prepared for tutoring this semester.

All upcoming assignments and coursework were discussed in detail. The primary discussion was about prioritizing preparation for assignments- order of assignment due dates- and reason for studying in order to pass exams. Specifically- the NSD final will be difficult because it requires memorization which may mean sitting and doing the online extra-credit modules. DJ is not committed to sitting for periods of time in order to pass the exam. It’s the sitting for an hour or more that is difficult. This is understandable but- in the case of the NSD final- necessary. Several blocks of time were identified for tomorrow and early next week to complete the NSD extra-credit modules. He noted he would ‘try’ to complete the modules by December 12- the day of the exam. The modules are not due until December 15 but he needs the content before the exam. 
DJ has assignments due the 9th- 11th- 12th- 13th- 25th- and 19th. He is aware of the order of due dates. DJ needs encouragement to sit through the online- extra-credit modules. The additional 4% added to his grade is not why he is doing them. These modules will support recall which he needs to pass the NSD exam.
“DJ’s writing is similar to a sprint. He has a fast moving voice that would benefit from elaboration.”
 “Time was spent discussing chunking his study time with short breaks in between each chunk of study time. The process would be something such as the following: 20 minutes study- 3 minutes off- 15 minutes study- 2-3 minutes off- 10 minutes study- 1-2 minutes off. Take a break of a couple of hours and repeat the process. In other available timeslots- study or review for about 3 to 5 minutes with his mind on the material and in the evening about 15 to 20 minutes that is a read- write- say- and record high detailed content. Note cards is an option to use for this type of exam preparation. “

Lax. Dec 6- 2023
1. What did you do?
Michael was on time and prepared. 
The final synthesis paper for CRS 325 is due Dec 15. The identified chapter was unclear but Michael expects to write this synthesis paper outside of tutoring because the PHI paper will take more time in tutoring.
The second PHI paper is due next Tuesday- Dec 12. The prompt was reviewed and discussed again in tutoring tonight. The lecture slide set on identity and death was also reviewed again. 
Michael decided to argue the affirmative for “Can we survive the death of our bodies?” The prompt suggested an organization and specific language to use in the argument. Additionally- terms such as material and immaterial must be defined for this paper. The paper was started but the argument will take time to write as Michael decides his thinking for the final reasoned argument to defend his idea. He will need to argue the affirmative and defeat the negative view. 
This will be a time consuming paper. The paper is to be 1200 to 1500 words. This is about five double-spaced pages- APA format- and 12 pt. font. Michael may ask for a short extension.

1. What did you do?
Jaheem was prepared for tutoring.
All coursework was reviewed and discussed for final due dates and preparation.
The HEA 332 course has a final paper that includes reflection about unhealthy behaviors that he is thinking about changing and that he is not ready to change. Additionally- he is to write about behaviors he has already changed. The two to four page paper is due December 15 and is worth 15 points. If Jaheem dos well on this paper- he could have an A in this class.

How to study for the final Nutrition exam was discussed in detail. It is important that Jaheem pass the final in this course. The final is not cumulative. Jaheem has a tutor for this course. He reported he was doing the Extra-Credit Modules as a study strategy. He noted that he might earn 4% by doing the modules. The discussion was that the 4% is not relevant but passing the exam is relevant. The goal in doing the extra-credit modules is to remember enough to pass the final exam. The lowest DAP grade will be dropped. If Jaheem can pass the final- his grade will significantly improve. Jaheem committed to me that he would do all of the extra credit modules in order to remember enough of the material to pass the final Nutrition exam.

The NEA course final assignment includes reflection about healthy behaviors.

1.	What did you do?
First games are Nov 7- 10- 15- 19th Tuesday- Friday- Wednesday- & Sunday and Nov 24- 25- 30th; Dec 4 & 9- 19.

Time was spent reviewing final exams and assignments. Sophie has two games during the last weeks of the semester- one is away and one home. She has demanding classes and will need to study for each of the final exams. There was a discussion about managing her study time. Sophie tends to do her academic work during the day- at least- before she is home in the evening. And once home in the evening- she does not study. Sophie put the final exams in her phone and she put her game schedule in her phone also.
Sophie is a confident student. She has a study structure that works for her. 
The PSY final exam she will not have to take because the first three exams are all As. This class will be an A grade for her this semester. The SOC Problems course has a final exam on December 14- next Thursday. Her grades in SOC Problems are all in the A range. The Oceanography course will have a final exam on December 11- Monday. The Nutrition exam is the next day- December 12. This will be a challenging exam. Her grades in Nutrition are all in the A range. Sophie has a study plan that includes using the extra-credit modules as a study strategy. The WRT course has fewer grades than other classes. The grades she has are all in the A range. 
There is a final in WRT. This is unusual and she will not know what the exam is until December 18.
Sophie knows how to be a student and has performed well academically. 

Next semester: PSY of Childhood- Micro ECON- ECON Lab- REL Conflict & Collaboration- PHI 197- (Kay 
Richardson) Human Nature; no Friday classes. Sophie is an undeclared major.

Sophie reports that folks she is in contact with seem to be ignorant about Australia. In particular- people seem to think all of Australia is the Outback and don’t seem to realize that there are world class cities in Australia.

5. Additional Comments: 
Sophie is from Australia. Her birthday is Dec 31.
She is a Small Forward or Power Forward- 3 or 4 positions
1st day of Practice- Sept 26
Practice 7:30-9:30 AM 
Day Off? Saturday
Sophie shared that she is diabetic and has Celiac Disease. She wears a pump and works with a Dietitian. 
Sophie shared that she talks with her mother every other day- every second day. She is “a little” homesick. She was not homesick the first month of school but she is feeling a bit homesick now. She is half way around the world from her family. 

Academic Identified Times
•	Sophie uses Sundays to complete most of her assignments especially for assigned HW. WBB games tend to be on Fridays and Sundays. Sundays may not work for academic work once her season begins.  The overall goal is to have all assignments completed by Friday evening. Sundays- if possible- will be when Sophie can check BB and her SU email for any changes in assignments of due dates.
•	Tuesdays and Thursdays have a daytime slot that she uses to complete NSD work. The timeslot will also be used for PSY and/or Oceanography. On Mondays- Sophie has a timeslot from 3:10-5:15. This is still a working plan for completing her academic work and should work when she enters her season. Sophie reports the courses are not too much for her. 
•	The Oceanography homework assignments are to be completed in Recitation so this gives Sophie more time to complete other assignments outside of classes and practice. Both lecture and recitation in Oceanography may be used as exam preparation. This was discussed and reviewed again in session tonight- 9-28-23.
•	Three minutes after class to review her notes while her mind is on the material is a strategy discussed and reviewed again in session. After the three minutes- she is to review this material in the evening for about 15 minutes then do not review it again until the next day. This process fosters recall.

Time was spent discussing all of her classes and upcoming final assignments and exams. Nea has completed most of this semester’s assignments. The FYS course is complete.

1. What did you do? 
Trey’s classes and grades were reviewed. He has a meeting with the WRT Instructor on Monday to discuss the final project which is Project #3. Project #2 has not been graded.

SPM should be his lowest grade due to two early missed assignments. FYS is an A. He submitted the three missed assignments. The final grade for this course is posted.

ECON should be in the B range. WRT still shows one grade which is 100%; the second project has not been graded or posted. Trey has a meeting with the WRT Instructor Monday. This is to plan and discuss the final writing assignment. It is an inquiry based paper/project due December 15.
The SOC course does not have a final exam date posted. The SOC 101 course will drop the lowest exam grade so this class could be a B or B+. Trey texted a classmate to be sure he hasn’t missed an announcement about the final exam. He will report his findings on Monday during tutoring.

Next semester- Trey has one class on Mondays at 9:30 AM and all other classes are on Tuesday- Wednesday- and Thursday. There are no classes on Friday. This benefits his travel schedule. 
His Lacrosse schedule was discussed and printed. There are a few mid-week games that could create problems and the month of March- due to traveling and midweek games- looks quite hectic for students.

Grades were updated during tonight’s session.

1. What did you do?
The final paper for CFE 700- Epistemic Injustice- was the purpose of today’s meeting. Alyssa wrote a significant amount of information for the final paper in this course. However- she struggled with organizing the information with a thesis and a conclusion. Time was spent reviewing her writing and finding the connections so that she could create a thesis that fit her sources and her ideas. Part of the conclusion of this paper will be a reflection. Alyssa is subbing in the Syracuse City School District and she will have experiences to use in her reflection. Additionally- she will be able to reflect on previous experiences and compare them to the new subbing experience.
One other paper was briefly discussed. The suggestion for this paper was to use Free & Reduced Lunch numbers of students to compare to academic support. She will decide if this is useful for the other paper.
2. Changes in assignment due dates:

I reminded him about this because normally- we work on those during his Tuesday appointments. However- since the focal point was the SOC 383 paper- he didn't make any progress on the response. He told me he would work on it on Wednesday since it was due then and we both wanted him to focus on the more immediately due paper.,He started the paper. I helped him by breaking down the prompt for him- so that it would be easier for him to see exactly what the instructor wanted. But with all his stress and distractions- he only managed to start it with a couple of sentences before I had to leave. ,He got a 1/2 on his last SOC 300 response- but we don't know why since the instructor gave no feedback. I do plan to take a look at his previous responses and that one along with the prompts in order to see if I can infer why he got a lower grade. ,I am concerned about Donovan's lack of focus. While I'm not sure what can be done since the source of his distraction is an ongoing case that could result in suspension or other consequences- it is definitely impacting his performance and ability to complete work. He noted to me at the start of our appointment that he didn't feel like doing anything over the weekend because of the stress from the case. , No,YES

1. What did you do?
Alyssa printed syllabi for all of her classes. She is taking four classes this semester.
Alyssa reported that she already read her syllabi and attended classes.
The goal is to establish a weekly- academic plan to accommodate all homework and so that assignments are prepared a week in advance of due dates. She is in-season and a schedule that has her working ahead of due dates will make a hectic semester manageable. Two timeframes were targeted for academic work- Tuesday afternoons and Fridays. She does not have classes on Fridays. 

Alyssa has a few mid-week games that will impact class attendance. She reports sending her travel letters to her professors.

Alyssa started the first PHI Response- due tonight by midnight. The reading was discussed and she had several ideas for the first response. The PHI responses do not need to be long but do need to include the three required parts of this assignment. Part of the grade in this course is participation. She reports she has participated so far. 

She reports not feeling too tired as a student-athlete and an athlete who is in her season.

Michael completed the video introduction of himself for the REL 103 course. The assignment requires students to say one thing about themselves- their major- where they are from- and what they want to learn in this course. Michael submitted the video introduction assignment. Michael is aware that if he follows the assignment requirements and submits them on time- he will do well in this class.
Michael likes writing and feels the WRT 205 class will be a good fit for him this semester.

1.	What did you do?
Saniaa came to tutoring wearing a boot. She reported being in pain and unhappy about being out of practice.

The current book for the CRS 388 is Free to Learn by Peter Grey. Saniaa has a process she uses for her 10-page papers. She reads the book- makes a diagram of key parts- concepts- and thinks about it. When she starts to write- she has complete sentences and correct grammar. Although this is somewhat pressured writing- it works for her. 
The next Spanish exam is tomorrow. Saniaa reports getting the hang of the Spanish grammar marks which are different from English. She also notes having to recall that modifying words are after the noun and this can be awkward. 
Saniaa made 3.8 GPA last semester. She has much to be proud of.
No new grades were reported in tonight’s session. See below.
Saniaa’s goal for this semester is to achieve a 3.9 GPA.

1.	What did you do? 
DJ received an email from Dr. Arnold regarding the recent assignment in the REL 103 course. The recent writing assignment was about the 1936 Olympics and Riefenstahl’s film Olympia (1938) and the 2008 Olympics in Beijing- China. TurnItIn found a 96% compatibility and prompted Dr. Arnold’s email to DJ. DJ has not received anything similar to this in his time at SU and was surprised by the similarities found in the AI tool TurnItIn. 
I read this written assignment and two other written assignments to see if there was consistency in his writing. The REL 103 assignment about ceremonies in sports and religion was more formal writing. I do not know DJ’s formal writing voice. I shared with him that I thought he missed some key points about Olympia. However- the writing did not look to be copied and pasted. My observations about this specific writing piece was that DJ was less interested in the topic and in the prompt. It seemed pressured writing but not taken out of Wikipedia or some other online source. A very brief check online did not reveal anything similar to his writing in the assignment.
Dr. Arnold asked DJ to put him in touch with his Academic Coordinator and/or tutor. DJ responded to Dr. Arnold noting that he would be willing to rewrite this assignment in front of Dr. Arnold or his designee. DJ was directed to his Academic Coordinator to advise him in this matter. Since Dr. Arnold did not report him to academic compliance- it is viewed that Dr. Arnold is willing to work with him in some way.

If necessary or if suggested- I am willing to meet with DJ for him to rewrite or redo this assignment and witness his personal writing. 

This was reviewed in session to prevent the grade he received on the HFS 474 exam. 
“Time was spent discussing chunking his study time with short breaks in between each chunk of study time. The process would be something such as the following: 20 minutes study- 3 minutes off- 15 minutes study- 2-3 minutes off- 10 minutes study- 1-2 minutes off. Take a break of a couple of hours and repeat the process. In other available timeslots- study or review for about 3 to 5 minutes with his mind on the material and in the evening about 15 to 20 minutes that is a read- write- say- and record high detailed content. Note cards is an option to use for this type of exam preparation. “

1. What did you do?
The EXE 435 current assignment is a term paper. Jaheem thought he did have the text for this course but located it in the online SU shelf. He used the text to work on a term paper. For some reason- Jaheem was confused about the prompt. He located the key information in the online text to respond to the prompt. 
There is a concern that Jaheem is not preparing for assignments enough in advance. This will be explored in the next session.

Time was spent reviewing for the PSY 205 Recitation. The current content is conditioning both classic and operant. Some of this content Sophie was prior knowledge form her High School in Australia. She was reminded that Operant Conditioning contains schedules and intervals which are different but are part of this content and can be confusing. 

Sophie prepared for the NSD 225 exam #2 as she prepared for exam #1. She did extra credit assignments and answered the Study Guide lists. She reported that this second exam was very hard. Sophie felt the extra credit study guides were very helpful for preparation for this exam.  Her grade is 90%. There were 60 MC questions.
So far- her favorite course is PSY. According to Sophie and in general- the content for NSD is very difficult and requires a lot of memorization. This remains true and she noted that exam #2 was quite hard. In addition- Sophie reported she was surprised she made 90% on NSD Exam #2. 
Sophie noted she may not be in attendance for tutoring next week. This is due to her basketball schedule for Media Day. Sophie is a confident student.

5. Additional Comments: 
Sophie is from Australia
She is a Small Forward or Power Forward- 3 or 4 positions
1st day of Practice- Sept 26
Practice 7:30-9:30 AM 
Day Off? Saturday
Sophie shared that she is diabetic and has Celiac Disease. She wears a pump and works with a Dietitian. 
Sophie shared that she talks with her mother every other day- every second day. She is “a little” homesick. She was not homesick the first month of school but she is feeling a bit homesick now. She is half way around the world from her family. 

Academic Identified Times
•	Sophie uses Sundays to complete most of her assignments especially for assigned HW. WBB games tend to be on Fridays and Sundays. Sundays may not work for academic work once her season begins.  The overall goal is to have all assignments completed by Friday evening. Sundays- if possible- will be when Sophie can check BB and her SU email for any changes in assignments of due dates.
•	Tuesdays and Thursdays have a daytime slot that she uses to complete NSD work. The timeslot will also be used for PSY and/or Oceanography. On Mondays- Sophie has a timeslot from 3:10-5:15. This is still a working plan for completing her academic work and should work when she enters her season. Sophie reports the courses are not too much for her. 
•	The Oceanography homework assignments are to be completed in Recitation so this gives Sophie more time to complete other assignments outside of classes and practice. Both lecture and recitation in Oceanography may be used as exam preparation. This was discussed and reviewed again in session tonight- 9-28-23.
•	Three minutes after class to review her notes while her mind is on the material is a strategy discussed and reviewed again in session. After the three minutes- she is to review this material in the evening for about 15 minutes then do not review it again until the next day. This process fosters recall.

Nea reports she was able to take the SOC exam while traveling. Her Academic Coordinator administered the exam and this was agreeable to her SOC professor. Her grade was 85%. She was pleased with this grade.
Nea declared her major to be Sports Management and has chosen classes for next semester.

Nea reports she has a posted list of assignments and she uses a planner. She crosses off assignments as they are completed and submitted. Nea is a focused student and has not missed any assignments. In addition- Nea does extra credit assignments when they are available. She is doing college level work in a language that is not her first language. She was shown They Say- I Say in tutoring tonight. This is a source with sentence starters that often foster elaboration and support developing a formal academic writing voice.  
Grammarly- Citefast- and Purdue OWL were recommended as support sites. Additionally- Deeple was recommended. Nea uses Citation Machine. 
Nea is traveling again next week. 
Nea’s goal for the semester is to pass her current classes and do as well as she can academically. Her other goal is to get better as a player. Nea reports she has played in most games. 
Nea studies at the end of the day and likes to finish by 8 or 8:30. She tends to go to bed by 10 PM. Nea reports that she feels better and is able to perform better when she is reasonably rested.

The goal of working a week ahead of due dates was discussed. This gives students more control over their weekly assignments and frees them if something is added to their schedule.

Lax. Oct 26- 2023
1.	What did you do?
Time was spent reviewing the assignment prompt for the PHI 107 paper on substance dualism. There are five sections to the paper. He is to argue for substance dualism after he explains what it is and gives an example. The explanation is- in part- the ‘if – then’ statement of substance dualism. He wrote the explanation using (feeling pain) as an example. He wrote the ‘if then’ formula for a logical argument and will need to complete the paper by Friday. Michael added several paragraphs and has about 700 or more words. The requirement for this paper is 1200 words. He added the objections to Descartes argument and wrote them in his own words but using the ppt slides as a guide.

This course and the paper on substance dualism are challenging for Michael. In fact- the paper using logic and the formula for a logical argument seems difficult for him. However- Michael has the ability to make a logical argument- he is simply unused to doing so. He has been asked to remain clear and to be careful with language in the paper and to think strictly logically as he writes each sentence. The course pptx lecture notes are used as reference for the paper. Michael is using the ppt notes to evaluate the argument for substance dualism according to Descartes’ Meditations.

5. Additional Comments: 
Michael is a Middy on the SU Men’s Lacrosse team. He is from Long Island and is a sophomore. Michael had to host two recruits who are here to see the SU program and team. 
Michael had a paper planner with him. He writes his assignments in the planner. He tends to write assignments weekly. Michael reports he likes to do an assignment as soon as it is assigned and he prefers his planner to using an Objective Sheet or his phone.
Practice and/or Training/Lift: 
11:30-1:30 (in season)

Michael’s goal for this semester and next semester is to earn a 3.00 GPA. This will allow him to declare a major. Michael was encouraged to think about steps to achieve his goal. He did not have steps in mind but will think about how to get to the 3.00 GPA.

1. What did you do?
Today marked the third practice for Saniaa since her foot injury. She is feeling better but her foot and arch are hurting by this time of the day. Saniaa reported that her grades this semester are not what she wants them to be. Her season has started and she still feels that her foot is not strong enough for a game.

The CRS 336 Instructor did not like that Saniaa has to either miss her class or leave early for ‘Shoot Around’ prior to the game Friday. The game is early. There was a conversation about how to manage the professor’s targeted displeasure directed toward Saniaa in class. It was suggested she talk with her Academic Coordinator so he can support her in this matter. It was also suggested that she let her Academic Coordinator and her Coach handle the issue with the Instructor and for her to not worry about this issue. It appeared Saniaa felt caught in the middle of the situation. She sent letters to all of her professor indication when she would miss class due to her sport.

Saniaa presents as exhausted and in some pain from her foot injury. She is not wearing the boot but is still not healed from the injury.
At my suggestion- Saniaa emailed the professor for CRS 388 asking for a short extension for the current 10-page paper. She is recovering from her foot injury and is keeping up with most of her coursework. She has to make up work for the CRS 388 course and needs to read the book for the 10-page paper due tomorrow. She has not asked for an extension in this class before and her grades on all of the papers are 100%. There is a good chance Dr. Rodriquez will grant her the extension. 

The current book for the CRS 388 is The New Science: Discovering Order in a Chaotic World by Margaret Wheatly. Saniaa has a process she uses for her 10-page papers. She reads the book- makes a diagram of key parts- concepts- and thinks about it. When she starts to write- she has complete sentences and correct grammar. Although this is somewhat pressured writing- it works for her. To date- Saniaa is behind in this assignment.
Saniaa needs to make up Journals 3- 4 and 5 in CRS 336. She forgot to submit these assignments. Saniaa reports that other assignments stay on her mind and these weekly or biweekly assignments become secondary and easy to forget. Her overall grade in this class is a C with three 0s for missed journals. It does appear she will be able to do these journals and submit them for credit. 

Saniaa made 3.8 GPA last semester. Saniaa’s goal for this semester is to achieve a 3.9 GPA. 
New grades were reported in tonight’s session. See below.

1. What did you do?
Jaheem was not feeling well tonight. He has upper respiratory symptoms such as coughing- sniffing- and dark circles under his eyes. He indicated he did not feel well and is tired. He was not pressed for an imminent due date for assignments but needed to complete the required sexual assault module for SU. Time was spent completing the module. Until it is completed- he will have a ‘Hold’ on her SU account. 
Jaheem’s recent online HW in NSD is 95%. The tutor is helping him and hopefully he is able to use this support as preparation for the exam.

There was a brief review of the Group Presentation for EXE 435. There is no formal assignment posted on BB but rather a brief paragraph and assigned groups. The topic is to be decided by each group. Jaheem’s group is researching burnout in athletes. 
The due dates for this assignment is the November- 14th. The presentation is to have handouts- slides or something similar or a pdf sent to instructor- 20 minutes in total- and 2-3 minutes per slide/segment/group member in the overall presentation. 
“Jaheem will use the athlete- Cristiano Renaldo- a footballer from Portugal on the Al Nassr Team. The presentation is about burn-out in athletes. Three additional sources- online but of sound academic quality- were located tonight. They are listed at the end of the report. 
For the next tutoring session- Jaheem will put all sources in a Google Doc. Notes will be added there and he can start his bullets for the Google slides or Microsoft power point visuals from this source. He will need about three slides for his part. 
No new grades were reported.”

This is still a concern: There is a concern that Jaheem is not preparing for assignments enough and enough in advance. This will be explored in sessions. This was discussed. Jaheem acknowledged that he has time to prepare for exams and that he will make changes so he is doing this in advance so there is not push just prior to the exam. This is- in particular- relevant to the NSD 225 course content.

1.	What did you do? 
DJ reported he feels great about the exam for the HFS 474 course. He studied by creating a quizlet and the course notes were reviewed in tutoring two weeks and one week prior to the exam. He also asked a friend to quiz him and he reviewed the quizlet he created. 
DJ reported that he wants to start all of his final papers early. Time was spent discussing the 5-7 page paper for HFS 479. He plans to use the book- Can’t Hurt Me. DJ was reminded that the paper needs reasoned arguments backed by theories and information from the class lectures and class Readings. Time was spent reviewing the book and the author’s personal story about childhood abuse.

 “Time was spent discussing chunking his study time with short breaks in between each chunk of study time. The process would be something such as the following: 20 minutes study- 3 minutes off- 15 minutes study- 2-3 minutes off- 10 minutes study- 1-2 minutes off. Take a break of a couple of hours and repeat the process. In other available timeslots- study or review for about 3 to 5 minutes with his mind on the material and in the evening about 15 to 20 minutes that is a read- write- say- and record high detailed content. Note cards is an option to use for this type of exam preparation. “

1.	What did you do?
First games are Nov 7- 10- 15- 19th Tuesday- Friday- Wednesday- & Sunday
Sophie reports that she did not study for the OCE test #3 for several reasons. She had the SOC exam and presentation the same day and needed time to prepare for both SOC assignments. Additionally- Sophie knew she will be able to drop the lowest OCE exam grade and she has 100% on both Test 1 & 2 and has one more exam in this class in December. She made a strategic decision and managed her time for all that was due. There have been conversations about managing her assignments and being in control of her coursework. This is one reason to plan all course work and to be prepared when assignments cluster for similar due dates and when the team travels or has multiple games in a shorter period of time. 

When the OCE grade is posted- Sophie will be able to determine how much she actually needs to study for the exam. She attends class- takes notes- and attends recitation. Sophie reports she has not missed any of the above. 

Sophie reports not attending the FYS class due to games. The class ends around 5 pm which is when she has to be at the Dome or to report for the game. She has an assignment that was due Tuesday. Sophie plans to do the assignment and submit it late. 

So far- her favorite course continues to be PSY. According to Sophie and in general- the content for NSD is very difficult and requires a lot of memorization. This remains true and she noted that exam #2 was quite hard. In addition- Sophie reported she was surprised she made 90% on NSD Exam #2. 
Sophie reports that folks she is in contact with seem to be ignorant about Australia. In particular- people seem to think all of Australia is the Outback and don’t seem to realize that there are world class cities in Australia.
Australian Expressions (We’re making a list of Australian expressions.)
Taking a piss = are you teasing me? Are you fooling around? Pulling my leg? 
Servo = gas station
Snag = sausage

4. Behavior/Struggles/Tardiness: 
No concerns whatsoever
5. Additional Comments: 
Sophie is from Australia
She is a Small Forward or Power Forward- 3 or 4 positions
1st day of Practice- Sept 26
Practice 7:30-9:30 AM 
Day Off? Saturday
Sophie shared that she is diabetic and has Celiac Disease. She wears a pump and works with a Dietitian. 
Sophie shared that she talks with her mother every other day- every second day. She is “a little” homesick. She was not homesick the first month of school but she is feeling a bit homesick now. She is half way around the world from her family. 

Academic Identified Times
•	Sophie uses Sundays to complete most of her assignments especially for assigned HW. WBB games tend to be on Fridays and Sundays. Sundays may not work for academic work once her season begins.  The overall goal is to have all assignments completed by Friday evening. Sundays- if possible- will be when Sophie can check BB and her SU email for any changes in assignments of due dates.
•	Tuesdays and Thursdays have a daytime slot that she uses to complete NSD work. The timeslot will also be used for PSY and/or Oceanography. On Mondays- Sophie has a timeslot from 3:10-5:15. This is still a working plan for completing her academic work and should work when she enters her season. Sophie reports the courses are not too much for her. 
•	The Oceanography homework assignments are to be completed in Recitation so this gives Sophie more time to complete other assignments outside of classes and practice. Both lecture and recitation in Oceanography may be used as exam preparation. This was discussed and reviewed again in session tonight- 9-28-23.
•	Three minutes after class to review her notes while her mind is on the material is a strategy discussed and reviewed again in session. After the three minutes- she is to review this material in the evening for about 15 minutes then do not review it again until the next day. This process fosters recall.

1. What did you do?
Nea reports she has assignments clustering next week. There are two exams on the same day and a presentation on the following day. Time was spent discussing all of her classes and the upcoming assignments. Nea has done all extra credit options for the SPM course. No extra-credit points have been attributed on BB yet and nothing has been posted on BB for the extra-credit work. Nea reports she has done 4 or 5 to date and there is one more she will be able to do for the semester. She was reminded that when extra-credit is offered- the total possible amount of points may not be earned but some part of the total may be earned.
Time was spent reviewing for the upcoming SPM exam. Nea used time to review the PowerPoint slides for this assignment.
Nea reports getting used to being ‘in-season’ and in college at the same time. 

“Nea declared her major to be Sports Management and has chosen classes for next semester.
Nea reports she has a posted list of assignments and she uses a planner. She crosses off assignments as they are completed and submitted. Nea works week to week for most assignments although she is aware of due dates further ahead than a current week. 
Nea is a focused student and has not missed any assignments. In addition- Nea does extra credit assignments when they are available. She is doing college level work in a language that is not her first language. She was shown They Say- I Say in tutoring tonight. This is a source with sentence starters that often foster elaboration and support developing a formal academic writing voice.  Grammarly- Citefast- and Purdue OWL were recommended as support sites. Additionally- Deeple was recommended. Nea uses Citation Machine. 
Nea is traveling the week after next week. The team will be traveling Thanksgiving week.
Nea’s goal for the semester is to pass her current classes and do as well as she can academically. Her other goal is to get better as a player. Nea reports she has played in most games. Nea studies at the end of the day and likes to finish by 8 or 8:30. She tends to go to bed by 10 PM. Nea reports that she feels better and is able to perform better when she is reasonably rested.”

Time was spent discussing study strategies for the upcoming exams- SPM Oct 18 and SOC 102 October 19. Chunking the material with short breaks in between was suggested. This was discussed in detail. The goal of working a week ahead of due dates was discussed. This gives students more control over their weekly assignments and frees them if something is added to their schedule.

1. What did you do? 
Trey was on time and prepared for tutoring. The overall goal this semester continues to be for all classes to have grades as high as possible to mitigate the possibility of a low or lower SOC 101 grade. 

Trey has ECON online HW due tomorrow and the SOC 101 group #3 assignment due the 15th. 

There was a discussion about the SOC 101 Group #3 Assignment. It is due November 15- next Wednesday. Trey sent six Readings to his Academic Coordinator. These can be shared with tutors and will be discussed during tutoring. Time will be spent reviewing enough content to show Trey how to use information from academic writing to answer possible questions about current assignment questions. Annotation may also be suggested as a means to excerpt information to support his responses. The readings will need to refer to the recent film- Inequality for All. Trey watched the film in class and has notes. He knows how to use a timestamp as a citation and will need to do so in the upcoming assignment.

1. What did you do?
Jaheem was on time and prepared for tutoring. 
His focus tonight was the group PowerPoint presentation due tomorrow morning. The presentation is to have handouts- slides or something similar or a pdf sent to instructor- 20 minutes in total- and 2-3 minutes per slide/segment/group member in the overall presentation. Google slides was used by Jaheem’s group. Jaheem added three slides and a slide with his references. This took some time to do and he worked into the next session which was a cancellation so he had the additional time needed for his contribution to the slide presentation on Burnout. 
Jaheem made sure his font was compatible to the others in the PowerPoint presentation. All sources were credible- science-based sources.
There was no time to report grades.
“Jaheem will use the athlete- Cristiano Renaldo- a footballer from Portugal on the Al Nassr Team. The presentation is about burn-out in athletes. Three additional sources- online but of sound academic quality- were located tonight. They are listed at the end of the report. For the next tutoring session- Jaheem will put all sources in a Google Doc. Notes will be added there and he can start his bullets for the Google slides or Microsoft power point visuals from this source. He will need about three slides for his part. 
No new grades were reported.”

This is still a concern: There is a concern that Jaheem is not preparing for assignments enough and enough in advance. This will be explored in sessions. This was discussed. Jaheem acknowledged that he has time to prepare for exams and that he will make changes so he is doing this in advance so there is not push just prior to the exam. This is- in particular- relevant to the NSD 225 course content.

1. What did you do? 
Trey was on time and prepared for tutoring. The overall goal this semester continues to be for all classes to have grades as high as possible to mitigate the possibility of a low or lower SOC 101 grade. 

Trey has ECON online HW due tomorrow; he will meet with his ECON tutor later tonight. 
The SOC 101 group #3 assignment is due the 15th. Time was spent discussing several of the readings assigned for this group assignment. The readings will need to refer to the recent film- Inequality for All. Trey watched the film in class and has notes. He knows how to use a timestamp as a citation and will need to do so in the upcoming assignment. Trey chose two readings to use for the assignment. He is also required to respond to one group member’s post. Trey decided to use Johnson’s Privilege- Oppression- and Difference and Berliner’s Effects of Inequality and Power vs Teacher and Schooling. Time was spent discussing each of the two articles as they apply to inequality and power in the USA.

1. What did you do?
Time was spent discussing all of her classes and the upcoming assignments. Nea has done all extra credit options for the SPM course. No extra-credit points have been attributed on BB yet and nothing has been posted on BB for the extra-credit work. Nea reports she has done 4 or 5 to date and there is one more she will be able to do for the semester. She was reminded that when extra-credit is offered- the total possible amount of points may not be earned but some part of the total may be earned.
Nea had three exams last week. She has the reset of this week and the Thanksgiving Recess without due dates. She plans to do the presentation for the Personal Engagement Plan next week. There should be no more than three slides and she can do something ‘creative’ for this final FYS assignment. She also plans to do the last extra-credit assignment next week. 
Dr. Adamo talked with Nea about qualifying for extended time since she is an ENL student. She expects to hear from him regarding this for the final exam. 

Nea reports getting used to being ‘in-season’ and in college at the same time. 

“Nea declared her major to be Sports Management and has chosen classes for next semester.
Nea reports she has a posted list of assignments and she uses a planner. She crosses off assignments as they are completed and submitted. Nea works week to week for most assignments although she is aware of due dates further ahead than a current week. 
Nea is a focused student and has not missed any assignments. In addition- Nea does extra credit assignments when they are available. She is doing college level work in a language that is not her first language. She was shown They Say- I Say in tutoring tonight. This is a source with sentence starters that often foster elaboration and support developing a formal academic writing voice.  Grammarly- Citefast- and Purdue OWL were recommended as support sites. Additionally- Deeple was recommended. Nea uses Citation Machine. 
The team will be traveling Thanksgiving week.
Nea’s goal for the semester is to pass her current classes and do as well as she can academically. Her other goal is to get better as a player. Nea reports she has played in most games. Nea studies at the end of the day and likes to finish by 8 or 8:30. She tends to go to bed by 10 PM. Nea reports that she feels better and is able to perform better when she is reasonably rested.”

1.	What did you do?
First games are Nov 7- 10- 15- 19th Tuesday- Friday- Wednesday- & Sunday and Nov 24- 25- 30th; Dec 4 & 9- 19.
Sophie reports that she did not study for the OCE test #3 for several reasons. One was she had the SOC exam on the same day. The OCE grade is 79% without studying. Sophie will be able to determine how much she actually needs to study for the final cumulative exam. She attends class- takes notes- and attends recitation. Sophie reports she has not missed any of the above. 
Sophie reports not attending a few FYS class due to games. The class ends around 5 pm which is when she has to be at the Dome or to report for the game. She has an assignment to make-up. Sophie did the assignment and submitted it. The assignment was completed and graded- 100%.
Time was spent discussing final exams and assignments. She has two games during the last weeks of the semester- one is away and one home. She has demanding classes and will need to study for each of the final exams. There was a discussion about managing her study time. Sophie tends to do her academic work during the day- at least- before she is home in the evening. And once home in the evening- she does not study. Sophie put the final exams in her phone and she put her game schedule in her phone also.
Sophie is a confident student. She has study structure that works for her.

Sophie reports that folks she is in contact with seem to be ignorant about Australia. In particular- people seem to think all of Australia is the Outback and don’t seem to realize that there are world class cities in Australia.

4. Behavior/Struggles/Tardiness:

5. Additional Comments: 
Sophie is from Australia. Her birthday is Dec 31.
She is a Small Forward or Power Forward- 3 or 4 positions
1st day of Practice- Sept 26
Practice 7:30-9:30 AM 
Day Off? Saturday
Sophie shared that she is diabetic and has Celiac Disease. She wears a pump and works with a Dietitian. 
Sophie shared that she talks with her mother every other day- every second day. She is “a little” homesick. She was not homesick the first month of school but she is feeling a bit homesick now. She is half way around the world from her family. 

Academic Identified Times
•	Sophie uses Sundays to complete most of her assignments especially for assigned HW. WBB games tend to be on Fridays and Sundays. Sundays may not work for academic work once her season begins.  The overall goal is to have all assignments completed by Friday evening. Sundays- if possible- will be when Sophie can check BB and her SU email for any changes in assignments of due dates.
•	Tuesdays and Thursdays have a daytime slot that she uses to complete NSD work. The timeslot will also be used for PSY and/or Oceanography. On Mondays- Sophie has a timeslot from 3:10-5:15. This is still a working plan for completing her academic work and should work when she enters her season. Sophie reports the courses are not too much for her. 
•	The Oceanography homework assignments are to be completed in Recitation so this gives Sophie more time to complete other assignments outside of classes and practice. Both lecture and recitation in Oceanography may be used as exam preparation. This was discussed and reviewed again in session tonight- 9-28-23.
•	Three minutes after class to review her notes while her mind is on the material is a strategy discussed and reviewed again in session. After the three minutes- she is to review this material in the evening for about 15 minutes then do not review it again until the next day. This process fosters recall.

1.	What did you do?
March 6: No Show
Feb 14: Elijah’s goal for this semester is to raise his GPA so he can transfer into Maxwell School. Elijah was earlier in the semester and reports he missed one REL 200 class and another class.

Elijah has this required text- The Ra Mayana- a classic epic poem- in an audio version. This is working well for him and he reports he listens to the text. Elijah reports the Midterm Exam is scheduled for Feb 22 but may be pushed back.
The Coaching Philosophy assignment for PPE 327 was graded as full marks- 20/20.
The first WRT 205 assignment was submitted February 12th. It is too soon for a grade. The next Project- Project 2- began Monday. This is an interview assignment and he will need to find an artist to interview. This week of assigned readings and texts will be important for the success of the Project 2 work. Elijah was reminded that attending class is critical to the success of this assignment because of the somewhat awkward nature of the assignment- interviewing an artist. 
Elijah has a calendar of assignments for February and March. He also has two pages of the WRT Project 2 list of readings and heuristic work for the interview assignment. He is not traveling this week or weekend so he will not miss Friday’s class.
Elijah was reminded that this time of year is important for upcoming exams and Midterm exams. It is wise not to miss any classes because the current material in lecture of recitation is like studying. 
Elijah’s birthday is Monday. He will be 20.
Next week’s Meet is in Clemson and Elijah will be away next week. Elijah leaves tomorrow for a Meet at Harvard and will go from there to South Carolina.

1. What did you do?
Time was spent discussing the new assignment in the REL course. The current essay is due April 3- Monday. The topic is Evangelical forms of Religiosity. The discussion was to write notes as she reads and to do so in the following organizational pattern. 
First write the name of the form of Evangelical Religiosity- the message- the evolution of the message- exclusions in the message such as definitions of family that may be narrow- and political alliances or points of view from the pulpit. Added to this is the audience or who makes up the Evangelicals. Recording this type of information will allow her to write from this organizational pattern and also meet the word count for the assignment (600-900 words).
Alyssa will use quotes as part of the evidence for this essay.
There will be a range of Evangelical forms of religion from Tent Revivals to Mega Churches. If Alyssa uses the suggested method- the process for writing the essay will be efficient and may serve as a template for the final essay in this course. 
The fourth essay does not show a due date but the final group project is April 29.
The books for this course are challenging to read in a timely manner so that she can use the ideas in the assigned essays. 

The Poetry course continues to work well for Alyssa. She had a rewrite due Monday- March 25 and thinks it will most likely raise her grade. Alyssa reports submitting the rewrite on time but there is no grade yet.

Two timeframes were targeted for academic work- Tuesday afternoons and Fridays. She does not have classes on Fridays. So far- the targeted timeframes for academic assignments and due dates are working. This will be examined throughout the semester to be sure these targeted times work for Alyssa. Alyssa reports that she has time to do the assigned readings for her classes. She tends to break up the readings over a few days. Alyssa also reports that when she has time during the week- she uses it for whatever assignment fits into that timeframe.

There was a discussion about re-entry from multiple travel times for away games. It takes time to get back into academic work and to find a rhythm for academics without basketball. 
Alyssa shared that she will go home for the Easter weekend and return Monday morning in time for classes. She hasn’t been home for ‘a while’ and is looking forward to the upcoming weekend.

1.	What did you do?
Michael focused on the Project 2 assignment which is a larger assignment but similar to the heuristic he did about NASCAR and his visit to the NASCAR Hall of Fame. The assignment requires 750-1000 words. The assignment criteria was printed and discussed in detail. In addition- an example of what this assignment is to be was posted and viewed in tutoring. The example showed an introduction that named the event- date- location- and production. In addition- there was a discussion about the type of play- the actors- and the history of this type of play. These things were pointed out to Michael. The NASCAR Hall of Fame website was used for information about the architecture- date of building/opening- the purpose- the artifacts and the appeal to “family-style tradition” of NASCAR. This information was in the introduction. There is another place on the website that will be used to note the mission and purpose of the NASCAR Hall of Fame- its humble beginnings- and its evolution to the sport it has become. Michael will work on this part prior to the next tutoring appointment and requested a longer session on Thursday.
The assignment is in his binder and was used to guide the organization of Project 2. 

This was reasserted in tonight’s session - The WRT 205 course requires students to keep an Arts Encounter Journal. Several options for the encounters have been discussed including using his phone to document the encounters. Tonight- this was reviewed again and suggestions were made which include using the sculpture of the Lacrosse player shooting from behind the net. It was explained to Michael that an encounter could and probably should include the process of the piece such as the lost wax process to create such a sculpture noted above. This is part of what an Arts’ Encounter Journal is to include. Reflections should also be included in such a journal. If Michael withdraws from this class- the Art’s Encounter Journal will not be a factor. 
Michael reassured this tutor that he has not and will not miss any assignments.

Trey Deere- March 25- 2024- Session #13
1.	What did you do? 
Brief review of Assignment: Trey wrote the Analysis part of the research assignment. The assignment refers to research that is not actually being performed. Trey was asked if he had to create a survey and send it out then organize and analyze actual data. He was unclear about this. He was encouraged to show the PSY TA what he wrote so far and ask if he needs to report (made-up) data to use in the analysis part of this assignment. The Methods and Analysis parts of the current assignment are due Wednesday- March 27. 
It is still unclear if Trey and his partner have to do an experiment and if a survey would be acceptable for a data source. In tutoring- Trey emailed the PSY 205 TA in session to clarify the source of the data for the current Study assignment PSY.
The current REL 103 assignment is the proposal or outline for the final video assignment. In the last session- Trey reviewed several of the examples posted for students to use as ideas for the final assignment. He noted he helped a student last semester with the video. Tonight- Trey reread the assignment for the final video. Time was spent discussing several choices for the final assignment. Trey emailed Dr. Arnold asking if using the Thompson brothers would work for the final. Dr. Arnold responded to Trey. He is able to interview Miles Thompson and focus on his contribution to the Medicine Game. Trey has the ability to interview Miles Thompson and he plans to do this. He was encouraged to contact Miles and ask if he could interview him and use a Zoom recorded session or audio interview recording as a source for this assignment. Dr. Arnold also noted that Trey would need to focus on the medicine game and its gift to the community and the posterity of the gift. Trey is excited about being able to interview Miles. He is able to interview Miles because he is retired from professional lacrosse. 
Trey was reminded to include at least two concepts from this course. Concepts would include exchange economy- worship of athletes and athletic ability- traditions such as color- uniforms- traditional actions (cheers)- ceremony and spectacle- and finding the sacred within the secular experience of sports. 

This will be reviewed in subsequent sessions: There was a discussion about late or missing assignments and how we might be able to mitigate this. Several factors were discussed. One is that when he has difficulty starting an assignment or engaging with the material- he is to bring this up immediately. The goal is to prevent late or missing assignments from becoming a habit or cycle. Trey was asked to think about the reality factor so that when an assignment time frame is not working for him- the academic work schedule is changed so that he can complete assignments.
Trey reports that he does not read (books) except for assigned material.

Sports Management (SPM) major.
Trey has a required onsite meeting with his advisor in Falk College. He scheduled a time to meet with his advisor during tonight’s session. March 18 @ 10:30 AM. Trey missed this meeting and has an advising hold on his account. He rescheduled the meeting for this Wednesday- March 20- at 12:30 pm. The appointment is for registering for next semester. 

PSY 205: Trey completed and submitted the Introduction to a PSY 205 research assignment. Trey reported he located six sources and started the Introduction. Trey located this assignment in Google workspace and started to write the introduction. His research topic is about cheating in romantic relationships. He is aware he will need to define cheating and also include a range of what defines cheating in non-married- college-aged couples. Trey was reminded that he will need to use more formal language for this assignment. 
The initial writing of the analysis includes the number of surveys returned and a process of organization. He also wrote that basic demographic data was included in the survey. This would be age- gender- and class of the college student population. One question would be about long-distance relationships and the number of reported ‘cheating’ events in this context.

1.	What did you do? 
Brief review of Assignment: Trey wrote the Analysis part of the research assignment. The assignment refers to research that is not actually being performed. Trey was asked if he had to create a survey and send it out then organize and analyze actual data. He was unclear about this. In tutoring- Trey emailed the PSY 205 TA in session to clarify the source of the data for the current Study assignment PSY. Trey reported that the TA confirmed there was no ‘real experiment’ so that he does not need to actually submit a survey for this assignment. Trey’s grades in PSY Recitation are the Research Assignment and these grades are inconsistent. He reported that he will add information to the Introduction part of the assignment. This was discussed. It was suggested he write who the audience would be for his research and include that Syracuse University approved the research as the official institution. It was also suggested he note in the Introduction the general demographics of the respondent pool and to note his motivation for this topic. He would be wise to note that this research contributes to research on this topic and to name or list the contributions. Other suggestions were to include distance relationship and to show differences in correlation between freshmen and seniors in frequency of ‘cheating’ for all relationships and for distance relationships.
In discussing the PSY 205 second exam- Trey noted he studied with his tutor and reviewed briefly on his own.it was pointed out that with a small amount of additional time in preparation- his exam grades would increase and could increase substantially. 
The current REL 103 assignment is the proposal or outline for the final video assignment. Trey emailed Dr. Arnold asking if using the Thompson brothers would work for the final. Dr. Arnold responded to Trey. He is able to interview Miles Thompson and focus on his contribution to the Medicine Game. Trey has the ability to interview Miles Thompson and he plans to do this. He was encouraged to contact Miles and ask if he could interview him and use a Zoom recorded session or audio interview recording as a source for this assignment. Dr. Arnold also noted that Trey would need to focus on the medicine game and its gift to the community and the posterity of the gift. Trey is excited about being able to interview Miles. He is able to interview Miles because he is retired from professional lacrosse. Trey completed the assignment and submitted it on time.
Trey reported that the instructor for the SPM course was fired. The new instructor is an Professor Emeritus and will come out of retirement to teach the remainder of this course for this semester.  
This will be reviewed in subsequent sessions: There was a discussion about late or missing assignments and how we might be able to mitigate this. Several factors were discussed. One is that when he has difficulty starting an assignment or engaging with the material- he is to bring this up immediately. The goal is to prevent late or missing assignments from becoming a habit or cycle. Trey was asked to think about the reality factor so that when an assignment time frame is not working for him- the academic work schedule is changed so that he can complete assignments.
Trey reports that he does not read (books) except for assigned material.

1.	What did you do?
Michael focused on the Project 2 assignment which is a larger assignment but similar to the heuristic he did about NASCAR and his visit to the NASCAR Hall of Fame. The assignment requires 750-1000 words. The printed assignment criteria was reviewed. Time was spent adding to his original introduction and including information about the NASCAR Hall of Fame from the museum itself. Michael was able to add an simulation experience. 
The NASCAR Hall of Fame website was used for information about the architecture- date of building/opening- the purpose- the artifacts and the appeal to “family-style tradition” of NASCAR. This information was in the introduction. Michael was reminded to add this site to his sources. Michael wrote the next paragraphs according to the rubric. He was able to move his conversation to the brands of tires after noting the brands on the painted race cars. 

The assignment was in his binder. Michael took it with him for reference. He plans to complete the final parts of Project 2 while away for a game this weekend. The assignment is due tomorrow by 11:59 pm.

This was reasserted in tonight’s session - The WRT 205 course requires students to keep an Arts Encounter Journal. Several options for the encounters have been discussed including using his phone to document the encounters. Tonight- this was reviewed again and suggestions were made which include using the sculpture of the Lacrosse player shooting from behind the net. It was explained to Michael that an encounter could and probably should include the process of the piece such as the lost wax process to create such a sculpture noted above. This is part of what an Arts’ Encounter Journal is to include. Reflections should also be included in such a journal. If Michael withdraws from this class- the Art’s Encounter Journal will not be a factor. 
Michael reassured this tutor that he has not and will not miss any assignments.

Trey Deere- March 21- 2024- Session #12
1.	What did you do? 
Brief review of Assignment: Trey completed and submitted the Introduction to a PSY 205 research assignment. Trey reported he located six sources and started the Introduction. Trey located this assignment in Google workspace and started to write the introduction. His research topic is about cheating in romantic relationships. He is aware he will need to define cheating and also include a range of what defines cheating in non-married- college-aged couples. Trey was reminded that he will need to use more formal language for this assignment. 
Trey wrote the Analysis part of the research assignment. The assignment refers to research that is not actually being performed. Trey was asked if he had to create a survey and send it out then organize and analyze actual data. He was unclear about this. He was encouraged to show the PSY TA what he wrote so far and ask if he needs to report (made-up) data to use in the analysis part of this assignment. The initial writing of the analysis includes the number of surveys returned and a process of organization. He also wrote that basic demographic data was included in the survey. This would be age- gender- and class of the college student population. One question would be about long-distance relationships and the number of reported ‘cheating’ events in this context. 
The current REL 103 assignment is the proposal or outline for the final video assignment. Trey reviewed several of the examples posted for students to use as ideas for the final assignment. He noted he helped a student last semester with the video. Trey was reminded to include at least two concepts from this course. Concepts would include exchange economy- worship of athletes and athletic ability- traditions such as color- uniforms- traditional actions (cheers)- ceremony and spectacle- and finding the sacred within the secular experience of sports. Trey thought he had an idea of what he might do for this assignment.
This will be reviewed in subsequent sessions: There was a discussion about late or missing assignments and how we might be able to mitigate this. Several factors were discussed. One is that when he has difficulty starting an assignment or engaging with the material- he is to bring this up immediately. The goal is to prevent late or missing assignments from becoming a habit or cycle. Trey was asked to think about the reality factor so that when an assignment time frame is not working for him- the academic work schedule is changed so that he can complete assignments.
Trey reports that he does not read (books) except for assigned material. 
Trey reported that tonight’s class was canceled and he is having dinner with his mother and grandmother tonight.

1.	What did you do?
Michael is discouraged in the WRT 205 class this semester. The course is using Art as the overall content for research and writing. Fine Art is not an area of general interest for Michael and he struggled to find Fine Art subjects to include in his writing. 
Time was spent on the current assignment- Rhetorical Summary Heuristic. Michael located a peer-reviewed article that he felt would work for his current assignment. The article is about NASCAR tire design and marketing this branded product. There are obvious rhetorical appeals but the art part of his interest is the design of a new tire and the appeal to the specific audience of marketing companies and race drivers. This assignment is due tonight by 11:59 pm. Design is part of the principles of design. In this context- design falls into the genre of marketing and into a Trade Journal. 
Michael left to complete the assignment with the two sentence summary of his research- peer-reviewed article. 
No new grades were reported.
Michael checked assignments in his planner and put additional assignments in his planner.

This was reasserted in tonight’s session - The WRT 205 course requires students to keep an Arts Encounter Journal. Several options for the encounters have been discussed including using his phone to document the encounters. Tonight- this was reviewed again and suggestions were made which include using the sculpture of the Lacrosse player shooting from behind the net. It was explained to Michael that an encounter could and probably should include the process of the piece such as the lost wax process to create such a sculpture noted above. This is part of what an Arts’ Encounter Journal is to include. Reflections should also be included in such a journal. If Michael withdraws from this class- the Art’s Encounter Journal will not be a factor. 

Michael will meet with his Academic Coordinator tonight at 7:50 pm. 
Michael reassured this tutor that he has not and will not miss any assignments.

Trey Deere- February 29- 2024- Session #8
1.	What did you do? 
Trey was on time and prepared for tutoring. At this time- Trey has a bit of a lull in assignment due dates.
Trey’s grade on the first PSY exam is 80%. He reports he studied the night before. This is a useful strategy but we are working to advance other strategies so that his grades improve. There was a discussion about study strategies. Trey reports he is a visual learner and not at all an audio learner. This is of use as we navigate several strategies for his best performance. The next suggestion is to spend 3 minutes after lecture in ECON and review his notes and the online ppt. Trey reports he will try this. Trey also noted he has used acronyms and silly remembrances to maintain some content. This is also useful for some types of information.
Trey completed an extra-credit syllabus search assignment for PSY during tutoring. This took some time but he completed and submitted the Ex-C work. NGY
ECON: Trey completed the practice modules as a way to prepare for the first exam. He decided this was not useful and- as of now- a waste of time. He will review the professor’s notes as preparation for the exam. He also noted that the Modules included math which was not needed for the exam. According to Trey- the professor announced that the first exam is the most difficult. Trey will change his study strategies and will continue to use visual strategies for exam preparation. 
Trey scheduled several SONA Studies. One SONA is a two-part Memory Study for .75 points @ 10:30. Trey is in class until 10:25 but is very close to the location of the Study (Huntington Hall). He has three SONA Studies scheduled. He will have 2 credits after next Friday’s Study. 
Trey discussed his experience during COVID and at the different schools he attended. 
The WRT Instructor canceled class again. She canceled earlier this semester because she had COVID and canceled for today or tomorrow due to the weather. Trey is aware he is still responsible for all posted material including readings.

1.	What did you do?
Michael was on time and prepared for tutoring tonight. Michael meets with the WRT professor on Monday at 1:00. The issue is that Michael did not submit the assignment correctly through the correct portal in BB. It is hoped he will be able to show his work to the professor and will find out how to correctly submit assignments for this class. He noted something similar happened to a team/classmate. 
Michael wrote the short summary of the Interview Assignment in session. He thinks he is supposed to post assignments via BB into his Sites platform. It appears he cannot post outside of BB. If he does so- the professor cannot see his work. 
Michael opened his Sites page in WRT in BB and submitted the Interview transcript and summary as specified in the requirements for this assignment. He republished the additions and everything showed in WRT in BB as it should. The professor should be able to see his submissions. 

This will be reasserted in the next session - The WRT 205 course requires students to keep an arts encounter journal. Several options for the encounters have been discussed including using his phone to document the encounters. Tonight- this was reviewed again and suggestions were made which include using the sculpture of the Lacrosse player shooting from behind the net. It was explained to Michael that an encounter could and probably should include the process of the piece such as the lost wax process to create such a sculpture noted above. This is part of what an Arts’ Encounter Journal is to include. Reflections should also be included in such a journal.  

Michael reassured this tutor that he has not and will not miss any assignments.

Trey Deere- March 18- 2024- Session #11
1.	What did you do? 
The WRT 205 course is becoming problematic for Trey. Trey submitted his second essay past the due date.  The first essay was not submitted and he is not eligible to resubmit it. The grade for the first assignment is 0. As of tonight- there was no feedback on his Project 2 assignment from the WRT 205 Instructor so the assumption is that the late submission is the reason for the reduced grade. This class is now an official ‘watch’ class and Trey is aware he will need to submit all assignments on time and not miss class. Trey was under the impression that the WRT Instructor would work with him for the first assignment but this is not the case. 
Trey needs to complete the Introduction to a PSY 205 research assignment. Trey reported he located six sources and started the Introduction. Trey located this assignment in Google workspace and started to write the introduction. His research topic is about cheating in romantic relationships. He is aware he will need to define cheating and also include a range of what defines cheating in non-married couples. Trey was reminded that he will need to use more formal language for this assignment. He was also reminded that the introduction should note why this research is useful and how it adds to current research on the topic. The plan is that he will continue to make notes for the introduction and be ready to write the introduction in the next tutoring session on Thursday. He may also be able to work on the introduction when working with his PSY tutor. 
His partner is either writing about another section of the research assignment or is to add to what Trey has already written in the Introduction. Trey will work on this assignment tonight after WRT 205 class. 
There was a discussion about late or missing assignments and how we might be able to mitigate this. Several factors were discussed. One is that when he has difficulty starting an assignment or engaging with the material- he is to bring this up immediately. The goal is to prevent late or missing assignments from becoming a habit or cycle. Trey was asked to think about the reality factor so that when an assignment time frame is not working for him- the academic work is changed so that he can complete assignments.
Trey was asked to put his meeting with his Academic Advisor in his phone with reminders. He reported that he did this. He wants to ask his Academic Coordinator to put it in his online academic schedule. (Orange Access?)
Trey reports that he does not read (books) except for assigned material.

1.	What did you do?
Michael is discouraged in the WRT 205 class this semester. The course is using Art as the overall content for research and writing. Michael does not like the Instructor and feels the Instructor does not like him. He may have interpreted assignments differently from the Instructor’s expectation. Art is not an area of general interest for Michael and he struggled to find Fine Art subjects to include in his writing. 
This course will need to be a priority for discussion and production of a product that gives Michael a better grade. He is considering withdrawing from this class. He will discuss this with his Academic Coordinator. 

For the PHP course- Michael reports that the professor removes quiz grades after they are posted on BB so he cannot go back and check his quiz grades. He also reports that a few professors are not using BB or are using it in a limited way for this semester’s courses. 

Michael checked assignments in his planner and put additional assignments in his planner.

This was reasserted in tonight’s session - The WRT 205 course requires students to keep an Arts Encounter Journal. Several options for the encounters have been discussed including using his phone to document the encounters. Tonight- this was reviewed again and suggestions were made which include using the sculpture of the Lacrosse player shooting from behind the net. It was explained to Michael that an encounter could and probably should include the process of the piece such as the lost wax process to create such a sculpture noted above. This is part of what an Arts’ Encounter Journal is to include. Reflections should also be included in such a journal. If Michael withdraws from this class- the Art’s Encounter Journal will not be a factor. 

Michael will meet with his Academic Coordinator tonight at 7:50 pm. 
Michael reassured this tutor that he has not and will not miss any assignments.

1.	What did you do? 
WBB travels this Thursday and hopefully plays and wins two games. After this weekend- they might go directly to Portland. 

According to Sophie- the ENG course may take the most time. As of March 18- this is still her opinion. Sophie reports not liking writing but this course is writing intensive. There are readings- film- and articles including Fatou Diome’s book The Belly of the Atlantic. There are two films per week; the films are full length. This is an upper level class thus the demand of the coursework. 
The PHI class is also a writing intensive course. She writes 600 word essays every two weeks. There is a final essay. Sophie has submitted six essays to date. She is required to submit 16 by May 8. Sophie’s backup plan is to write the remaining essays and/or the final essay on her flight home. The flight is about 30 hours; the last leg is about 16 hours.
Sophie reports that she is managing her coursework fairly well while traveling and being in tournament and section play. She reported waning to do more academic work during the Spring Recess but that did not work for her. The WBB team had a few days off during the Recess.

1. What did you do?

Time was spent discussing the new assignment in the REL course. This assignment requires students to read the book- Gen Z Explained- the introduction of the text- Week 5 discussion notes- and to use lecture notes and no other resources for this essay. The first essay grade was 4/10. The new assignment handout stated at the top of the assignment and in bold- “Read Carefully’. The implication is that Alyssa is not the only person who did not interpret the assignment as intended. The professor’s feedback is not to summarize but directly answer the questions. In addition- the suggestion is to use more quotes to substantiate the points made in her writing and to be sure she understands the question. 
The upcoming assignment/essay is about the Evangelical forms of Religiosity but the due date has not been posted. It is hoped the assignment will be assigned and the due date determined so Alyssa can complete this essay in a timely manner. Additionally- it would be of use to start the next assignment in tutoring to get a start on this assignment. 

Alyssa is completing the reading assignments for the REL class. There are three books and the online text for this course. However- she noted she is behind in the book readings. The books for this course are challenging to read in a timely manner so that she can use the ideas in the assigned essays. 

The Poetry course is working well for Alyssa. She has a rewrite due Monday- March 25 and plans to do this which will most likely raise her grade. 

Two timeframes were targeted for academic work- Tuesday afternoons and Fridays. She does not have classes on Fridays. So far- the targeted timeframes for academic assignments and due dates are working. This will be examined throughout the semester to be sure these targeted times work for Alyssa. Alyssa reports that she has time to do the assigned readings for her classes. She tends to break up the readings over a few days. 
Separately- she noted that the difficult part of the NSD midterm was the early course lecture information and it was difficult to keep this information fresh enough for midterm preparation. She will be traveling with WBB team and will likely miss he early information/lecture after the midterm which will be the same problem as for the midterm. 

2. Changes in assignment due dates: 
None reported at this time.
3. Updates on assignment completion: 
All classes meet twice weekly and there are no recitations.

1.	What did you do?
Michael was about 10 minutes late for tonight’s appointment. This was because he was meeting with his PHP Professor. Michael missed a quiz and will be able to complete it because the professor will reopen it so Michael can submit the quiz.
Michael reported that he did not eat all day and could not concentrate well. He was exhausted and overdone. He put time in starting the reflection and will complete it after tutoring and after he is able to eat. He did get some food during tutoring and also drank water. 
He prepared for tutoring tonight. 

Michael submitted the WRT 205 Project 2 assignment on his Sites page but the initial submission did not allow the professor to see his work. He received a 0 on the assignment. Michael met with the professor who allowed him to resubmit the project 2 assignment so the professor can see his work. The project was resubmitted. There is no grade yet.

The second WRT assignment is an interview with a transcript and audio submission of the interview. This project was submitted correctly on his Sites page. Michael reports that he could choose an artist as defined broadly. He interviewed a Newhouse major who Michael sees and an artist in the field of public communication. The person he interviewed is a friend and teammate. Michael sees his friend’s Blog as a form of art. He reported the professor approved of his choice for this assignment.
The current WRT assignment is a reflection of the project 2 interview assignment. Michael was reminded that the purpose of a reflection in WRT is to note what could have been added to his project to make it more interesting and to add complexity or depth. Michael was reminded to note that a Blog is an individual point of view just as a painting or photograph shows something from an artist’s point of view.
The next tutoring session will re-review assignments including any that may be due the Monday and Tuesday after Spring Recess.

This will be reasserted in the next session - The WRT 205 course requires students to keep an arts encounter journal. Several options for the encounters have been discussed including using his phone to document the encounters. Tonight- this was reviewed again and suggestions were made which include using the sculpture of the Lacrosse player shooting from behind the net. It was explained to Michael that an encounter could and probably should include the process of the piece such as the lost wax process to create such a sculpture noted above. This is part of what an Arts’ Encounter Journal is to include. Reflections should also be included in such a journal.  

Michael reassured this tutor that he has not and will not miss any assignments.

Trey Deere- March 4- 2024- Session #9
1.	What did you do? 
Trey was on time and prepared for tutoring. Trey has a bit of a lull in assignment due dates. 
Trey scheduled several SONA Studies. One SONA is a two-part Memory Study for .75 points @ 10:30. Trey reported completing this Study today and received confirmation. His total is 1.25 credits. He has three SONA Studies scheduled. He will have 2 credits after Friday’s Study. 
Current assignments were checked in REL 103. He has four videos to watch and one reading. This week is about US ‘Indian’ Schools that forced young native youth to attend- to dress like Whites- and to speak English and not their native language. One film on panoply- a full length film- is one Trey has seen. He noted his grandfather was forced to attend such a school. Trey was reminded to watch the short videos so he is prepared to discuss them in class. He was also reminded that any conversation about ‘Indian’ Schools is something he could comment on and Dr. Arnold would find interesting. 
The WRT 205 Instructor canceled class last week. Trey is aware he is still responsible for all posted material including readings. There are no grades for this class. Trey submitted his second essay without feedback on his first essay. This course may become more demanding after Spring Recess. 
There were a few new grades in PSY. These were the Study like a Champ book short assignments. Trey missed Assignment #2 in PSY. He can use the “Oh Shit” clause for one and only one assignment. Additionally- he may be able to drop a lowest grade for assignments. This will be verified. Trey noted the missed assignment was at a “bad” time. 
The next session assignments that are due the Monday or Tuesday after Spring Recess will be checked and due dates discussed for best effort and submission. 
Trey reports that he does not read (books) except for assigned material. 
There was enough time for Trey to complete his housing for next semester.

1. What did you do?
Alyssa was prepared for tutoring. She looked exhausted but was able to attend to tonight’s session.

Time was spent discussing the new assignment in the REL course. This assignment requires students to read the book- Gen Z Explained- the introduction of the text- Week 5 discussion notes- and to use lecture notes and no other resources for this essay. The first essay grade was 4/10. The new assignment handout stated at the top of the assignment and in bold- “Read Carefully’. The implication is that Alyssa is not the only person who did not interpret the assignment as intended. The professor feedback is not to summarize but directly answer the questions.
Three are three questions in this assignment.

Time was spent discussing the assignment question. Suggestions were as follows: 
Copy and paste the assignment questions into her essay draft
Remove the questions when the essay is complete
Look up the quote which is topic for this essay
Read what is before and after the quote to get more information- meaning- and application of the quote-
Use the suggested thought guides to complete her sentences - as noted in the assignment
Use a few short quotes or refer to page numbers when making a point
Use logic/reasoning when making a point
She can use her own experience with organized religion but also use the text material o support her ideas
Week 5 notes for discussion have not been posted yet-
Use bulleted ideas and put them down quickly – make them into sentences later 
Organize the bulleted notes/ideas after she has generated a number of them and has enough to put into content/idea groups
Organize the groups of bulleted ideas
The last question is her impression or her reaction to the quote for this assignment. Here she can show any disagreement with the authors-

Alyssa is completing the reading assignments for the REL class. There are three books and the online text for this course. However- she noted she is behind in the book readings.

Two timeframes were targeted for academic work- Tuesday afternoons and Fridays. She does not have classes on Fridays. So far- the targeted timeframes for academic assignments and due dates are working. This will be examined throughout the semester to be sure these targeted times work for Alyssa. 
Alyssa has a few mid-week games that will impact class attendance. She reports sending her travel letters to her professors. 
2. Changes in assignment due dates: 
None reported at this time.
3. Updates on assignment completion: 
All classes meet twice weekly and there are no recitations.

1.	What did you do?

Michael has a PHP assignment due tonight. He used Word and the ‘smart art’ which has diagrams that fit this assignment. He located a diagram and put text in it for the craving cycle assignment. There were five questions to answer to understand the craving cycle. This was done. Michael used under eating and overeating as his unhealthy craving habit. 

Michael is aware he has a quiz due for PHP and will take in on Saturday in Virginia. He assured that he will remember to take the quiz.

This was reasserted in tonight’s session - The WRT 205 course requires students to keep an Arts Encounter Journal. Several options for the encounters have been discussed including using his phone to document the encounters. Tonight- this was reviewed again and suggestions were made which include using the sculpture of the Lacrosse player shooting from behind the net. It was explained to Michael that an encounter could and probably should include the process of the piece such as the lost wax process to create such a sculpture noted above. This is part of what an Arts’ Encounter Journal is to include. Reflections should also be included in such a journal.  
Michael was reminded that he may see art while away in Virginia that could be part of his Arts Encounter Journal. 

Michael reassured this tutor that he has not and will not miss any assignments.

Trey Deere- March 7- 2024- Session #10
1.	What did you do? 
Trey was on time and prepared for tutoring. 
The WRT 205 Instructor canceled class last week. Trey is aware he is still responsible for all posted material including readings. There are no grades posted for this class. According to Trey- he submitted his second essay without feedback on his first essay. 
This was not the case. In tutoring tonight- Trey completed assignment/project 2. He completed 844 words which met the assignment criteria (800-1000 words). This assignment was about artwork known to Trey and he chose J Cole’s album. He included the album cover and lyrics of specific songs. Trey felt he could write more about this assignment. He needed about 250-300 more words and accomplished this. Project 2 was completed and submitted in tutoring.
Trey needs to complete Project 1. He chose a photograph by the artist- Wendy Red Star- a photograph at Light Work Gallery. However- he felt he could not write 800 words about his choice. This was a roadblock for him. He noted he would talk with the professor about a choice for Project 1 tonight in class. 
Trey and his partner need to complete the Introduction to a PSY 205 research assignment. Trey reported he located six sources and started the Introduction. His partner is either writing about another section of the research assignment or is to add to what Trey has already written in the Introduction. Trey will work on this assignment tonight after WRT 205 class. 
In the future- assignments will be viewed in his Grades section to verify submissions and/or completion of assignments. 
Trey reports that he does not read (books) except for assigned material.
