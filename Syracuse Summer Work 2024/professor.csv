The semester requires the completion of 3 projects and 2 have been completed so far. The grades for the 3 projects will be averaged out at the end of the semester resulting in a fiNo Commentl grade. Benne's current average is a C-, mostly due to the one late project, but I am confident that will turn around in the coming weeks.",1,0

He has never contributed to course discussions, seems to sit out on small group work, and has shown up and left class almost immediately--when we visited the SU Art Museum for a project.

I've flagged him previously in this system and others, but I've never received any sort of feedback (and he's never reached out). His primary issue is that he doesn't come to class and it shows in his general iNo Commentbility to engage content - he's also tried to turn in homework for classes that he didn't attend. I don't think he has much interest in this class, which is a shame because when he is focused (which is rare), he's smart. But after several flags and no response, I can only again say that he's at risk.",1,1
